"What would the world sound like without the constant humming of motors everytime you walked outside? It would sound pretty strange, right? Well, people from around the world have already restricted car use, and they love it. Some areas restrict car usage because of pollution, some just because they find that while driving a car you're stressed. Others don't restrict car use, but the people choose not to drive for their own reasons.

In one source,

In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars , it said that passenger cars are responsible for 50 percent of greenhouse gases in some car intensive areas in the United States. In the United States, cars are the second leading pollutor, right behind power plants. In 2014, Paris had enforced a partial driving ban, according to the artical

Paris bans driving due to smog . The partial driving ban consists of having motorists with even numbered plates keep their cars at home, then having the odd numbered plates to the same the next day. Diesels had made up 67 percent of vehicles in France compared to a 53.3 percent average in Wester-Europe. Most all of these people who stopped driving were happy, some even sold their cars to move to Vauban, Germany.

""When I had a car, I was always tense. I'm much happier this way,"" said Heidrun Walter in

In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars . Most people when driving a car are usually stressed because they're worried about hitting a pedesrtian or hitting another car on the road. Bogota, Colombia, according to

Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota , has a Day Without Cars and it has already spread to two other cities, Cali and Valledupar. ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution,"" said businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza while riding a two-seat bike with his wife. Most people participate, and the rain doesn't stop them. Parks and sports centers also have been getting business, aswell as the sidewalks being replaced with new and smooth ones. As a result, new businesses have popped up.

In

The End of Car Culture , it says that in recent studies, it suggests that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by. Also, another study found that driving by younger people decreased 23 percent between 2001 and 2009. Some of the reasons of this sudden drop is because of unemployment and money issues, but Mimi Sheller, a sociology professor at Drexel University and director of its Mobilities Research, has said that some factors is that of the Internet. The Internet makes telecommuting possible and allows people to feel more connected without having to meet up with friends. Since the peak in miles in 2005, the average number of miles driven per person has dropped just below 9 percent under the peak, the same to where it was in January 1995. Most find use in the public transportation to get around.

In the end, driving is progressivly losing its need to get from one place to another. Pollution is being delt with by restricting car use, and people are much happier with using public transport and not having to drive so often. Maybe someday soon the dream of the absence of the humming of motors and car-filled streets will become a reality.",False
"Ths technology is has helping the humans by their invention over the time.

The software that detect how people are feeling, while they are try to hide their emotions. The system is called the Facial Action Coding Systemis now on variety of industries. It classifien on the basic emotion like happy, surprise, anger, scary, and sad. The computer it structure by a 3-D model of the face to detect their feeling.

When you are happy and smile looking on the computer it going to detect, so how has you been. In school, is better and helping in students doing better on their grades so, facing to the screen of your classroom that students if they are boring or just confused on their class. Showing student they don'tlike the class by their teaching. Also students it just wanted it to be an interesant topic on each of their class. It also developing wat to communicate with humans and computers.

It help us by recognize the face of our peer, ""For instance, you can probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on her face. Of course, most of us would have troubles actually describing each facial triat conveys happy, worries, etc."". Just the computer can know the feeling you feel. if we face with an angry face but meanwhile it showing a happy face to us.""They even indicate the difference between a genuine smile and a forces one"". By identifity a real smile not a fake one its muscle it go the cheek. A fake smile the mouth its stretched sideway

Is describe how the computer can detect on a real face or just on a painted face descrbing of the facial movement were. The muscle of the facial is not expresses their emotion, and also can structure of their face with a smile. By feeling other their emotinos it can also us feel it,as just of creating an emotions. Describing a face is can't lie because of their different muscles, is just telling the truth of your self. It just to communicate between humans and computers with their feeling.",False
"Cars have been in use ever since World War II. Yet, more and more people have been limiting their usage of cars. Many take the alternative of bikes or buses, which ultimately creates benefits for not only one's self, but as well as all of the other people within the area. The benefits of limiting car usage are lowering pollution, creating less road and city congestion, and stress relief.

First of all, people have known for years that cars are a large source of air pollution. However, what most don't know is that ""passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe... and up to 50 percent in some car intensive area in the United States"" Rosenthal, Elizabeth Paragraph 5. ""Cold nights and warm days caused the warmer layer of air to trap car emissions"" Duffer, Robert Paragraph 15. Therefore, not only do the car emissions go into the atmosphere, but it gets trapped there, so the more cars being used, the more emissions get built up and added. By limiting the usage of cars, the car emissions in the atmosphere that create air pollution can be reduced.

Secondly, many big cities have to deal with cars and traffic contesting the area. ""BOGOTA, ColombiaIn a program that's set to spread to other countries, millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work during a carfree day yesterday, leaving the streets of this capital city eerily devoid of traffic jams"" Selsky, Andrew Paragraph 20. This allowed more room for people to move along the roads and without having to worry of being hit by a car. ""Rushhour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic"" Selsky, Andrew Paragraph 28. In doing so has allowed for pedestrians to be safer when crossing roads. A benefit in which prevents a hospital bill.

Lastly, stress relief can come from limiting the usage of cars, including relieving stress. ""'When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way,' said Heidrun Walter, a media trainer and mother of two, as she walked the verdant streets where the swish of bicycles and chatter of wandering children drown out the occasional distant motor"" Rosenthal, Elizabeth Paragraph 3. Heidrun isn't the only one who agrees that life without a car is less stressful. ""'It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution,' said businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza as he rode a twoseat bicycle with his wife"" Selsky, Andrew Paragraph 24. Arturo and his wife were participants of the Colombian carfree day program. When you live a stressless life, it is proven that you can live longer, especially when replacing your car with exercise.

In conclusion, the benefits that come with limiting car usage are a healthier world. One, by replacing your car with exercise and relieving stress. Two, by lessening road accidents. Three, by lessening air pollution, which is not only better for the environment, but yourself. By limiting car usage, all of the benefits work out in your personal favor.",False
"I am with the idea of the FACS becaues it seems vary interesting. The idea of a machine that can read emotions is cool. Though can be a little scary that commputer can tell if your happy or sad. But the idea is still cool to think about. I would like to see if they can even get the FACS to work on animals in the furture.

A reasion this could be a good idea is becaues you be able to tell if some one is lying to you. Like if there is a bad persion in court and you wont to know if there lying to your face you just look at the machine and it would tell you. Though some people would like to keep some things a scorit you be able to tell is there lying to you and if there sad as well then you know its a secorit. Many people would be saved and devastated by this machine.

My second reasion for going with the FACS is becaues it may be able to uncover crimes like if the dead persion was sad or happy when they die. Some family members may want to know that but will never know if they don't have the FACS. The FACS seem to be good on paintings so I was thinking that it may work on a dead body. Becaues if it works on Mona Lisa, then it should work on anything that dont use muscle ever or in the past like a dead body.

My therd reasion is if you make it be useable on animals then we can uncover a lot of mysteryes. Like if you wanted to know how your dog or cat felt about you all you had to do was turn on the FACS and see. We could also see if lions kill becaues there mean or becaues they dont know what eals to do. Many things could be uncover thnks to FACS.

Thess are my reasions for choosinf the FACS becaues it can help humans in many ways. We could be one step closer to uncovering mystoryes. I like the idea but many people may dissagree becaues they might say that they want to keep things scroit. But like I sead earlyer use the machine if there lying but also sad then you know it is a scorit. So I beleve the FACS should be able to go to anyone that wants it but that is just a thought.",False
"I am both against and for this new techonology device. It has both good and bad things to it and I will explain both why I think its a good idea and why I think its a bad idea, Here is why I think its a good idea. It can be a good idea for the guidance office of a school if a student is there for help. They can tell if the student is happy, sad, angry, or disgusted. It can help them understand what kind of emotions that practicular student is feeling, It also can be good with the example the author provided where if you smile on your computer a web ad appears but if you frown the next ad will be different. These examples are great ideas of why this technology device can be a great and helpful device.

This technology device could also be a bad idea and here is why, The device could be used on a student that doesn't really feel comfortable about giving their emotions to another person. If students have so much freedom with this device to read anyones emotions it could result in someone getting uncomfortable. Not everyone is going to want their emotions to be exposed. So if you give this device to some people they could easily humilate someone by exposing their emotions at the wrong time. For example, it could go wrong if a boyfriend was to use it on his girlfriend without the girlfriends permission and could ruin their relationship just like that.

In conclusion to these arguments supporting the technology and going against it. The device should be used in hands that are supposed to have it. Someone who has experience with the device and not anyone who is new. Someone who is mature enough to use it with polite manners, Not someone who is going to use it on each and every person they see. But use it with permission and not without someones consent.",False
"The use of technology to read emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable, it can detect the emotions of someone trying to hide their emotions, it can detect how you or someone else feels, and computers can find out if you like, hate, or confused about something.

In a real smile the zygomatic major lift the corners of your mouth, but in fake smiles the mouth is streched sideways using the zygomatic major and the risorius.

It uses muscular action units to indicate the difference between a genuine smile and a forced smile.

With Facial Action Coding Systems people can see genuine or forced facial expressions, feeling of people with just their facial expression, and could allow computers to find out what you like or dislike.",False
"Most people seek advice from multiple individuals when faced with a problem, and they have good reason too. Speaking to multiple people about advice can help the person searching for it open new doors. Seeking advice from others is highly beneficial because they can help the person see another point of view or help him or her see flaws or strengths in an already existing idea.

When someone asks multiple people for advice, that person is given the opportunity of seeing different points of view. Perhaps this person could see no other option but his or her own. But since all of our brains work differently, going to other people for new ideas could help open up other pathways to a solution.

Additionally, seeking advice from multiple persons may help the seeker see a flaw in an existing idea. Hearing what other people think about an individual's idea could help see what could be improved upon. Similarly, this could also help that individual see strengths that prove that his or her's initial idea is the right choice.

In conclusion, gathering advice from many people helps someone see new possibilities to an idea or see strengths and weaknesses of a preexisting one. Getting a fresh look at a problem can help someone see new ways it can be solved. Advice from others can also help critique an idea. The many people that seek advice from multiple sources are utilizing every tool they have access to.",False
"Dear State Senator,

There are many issues concerning the Electoral College and whether to keep it or changing election by popular vote for the president of the United States.  The Electoral College is very important considering it has educated canadates.  The people do not understand that the United States has many uneducated people.  They do not realize that if there is no Electoral College, the people with education will vote to directly decide the president, but so will the uneducated people.  The Electoral College wants the best for our country and is trying to benifit the USA, not cause it harm.

Though the Electeral College is a benefit and means no harm, it does have its flaws.  Many people when they vote for example, a democratic representative, they expect the democratic representative to vote for the democratic canadate for president.  Unfortununtly, sometimes that is not the case.  The democratic representative will end up voting for the Republican canadate for president.  This issue occurs many times in the Electoral College which is why people are having second thoughts about the Electoral College and wanting to eliminate it so that they can directly vote for the president or vice president they want and think will improve our country more.

The Electoral College is benefitcial because it is educated people trying to figure out by anallyzing and concluding who will represent and run our country the best way possible.  In the first article, it says ""MOST states have the ""winner-takes-all"" system"", but in the second article it says ""Because of the winner-take-all system in EACH state"".  In the second article, one of the arguments as to why the Electoral College should be abolished is incorrect due to the fact that not every state has the ""winner-takes-all"" system.  Since they got imformation wrong, people can not count this article as a reliable source of information.

Our counrty has been doing very well compared to the other countrys like Korea, Africa, Cuba, China, and etc.  People should just be grateful and apperciative that the United States is doing as well as it is doing.  The Electoral College is a benifit and it should not be abloished or eliminated from congress, but it should be improved.  We as americans should try to advance our country in every way possible, not eliminate something if it does not go our way.  We should try to cooperate and improve on the mistakes to make our country better and progress everyday so that today is better than yesterday, and tomorrow better than today!

"We have all had to make a tough decision, and we have all gone to others for help when making that decision. This is nothing to be ashamed of because people are smart, and the more people thinking about what to do in a situation, the better the solution is. When someone is making a tough decision it is crucial that they talk to others before making a final decision. First of all, by talking to other people you might find that they have better solutions that you never thought of because you were too close minded. Secondly, having others agree with your decision can make you feel more confident in your choices. Lastly, sometimes simply by telling someone your decision you yourself can find things to improve on.

Talking to multiple people before making a decision can help you find other solutions that you never would have considered. For example, last summer I was deciding whether or not to apply to Generic_School. Currently, I was planning on not applying because I didn't believe I would stand a chance and I did not want to waste 100 of my parents dollars. This all changed when I asked my mom for her opinion. When I told her my plan she said to me, ""Well, you will never know if you can make into Generic_School it if you don't try."" This inspired me and made me realize that it is not a waste of money if I try my best and work hard. This is a prime example of how consulting others can open your eyes to make better decisions.

A second reason to ask multiple people for their opinion is because knowing that others agree with you on a choice you are making can make you feel more confident in that choice. After my mom changed my mind and convinced me to apply to Generic_School I continued to ask others if they thought I was making the right choice. Having others, such as my dad, brother, and close friend, agree with me made me even more confident that I was making the right choice.

The final reason why asking others about the decision you are making is the right thing to do is that telling someone your thought process to reach a decision may expose to you any flaws that can be fixed. Think back to a time when you were writing a paper. After working on it for a couple of hours you were sure you had worked out all of the mistakes. Then suddenly when you went to read it to someone you realized that there are so many grammar flaws that you just did not realize when writing the paper. I believe that it is the same with decisions. If someone simply tells someone else their decision they might realize something that they do not think is right and change their decision. By simply telling someone your decision you could save yourself from making a bad choice.

Talking to others before making a decision is the best thing you can do for yourself. Even though someone may think they are making the best decision it is always helpful to get other opinions because maybe someone else has a better idea. Having someone agree that you are making the right decision can help you feel more sure that you made the right decision. Even if neither of these things are the case, by telling someone your decision and the thought process behind it you may find a kink in the process that when worked out, can help you make a better decision. All of these reasons are why I am asking you to ask others for advice before making a decision, because you know what they say, two minds are better than one.",False
"Who knew that a planet referred to as Earth's ""twin"" could possibly provide so many unknowns to humans? Venus is the second planet in our solar system and is the ""closest planet to Earth in terms of density and size, and occasionally the closest in distance too"". Venus has a more harsh environment than Earth. With a surface temperature of over 800 degrees, and a thick atmosphere of nearly 97 percent carbon, Venus is not tolerable for humans. Despite these presented dangers, the author of the article suggests that studying Venus is worth the risks.

The author of the article mentions clearly in paragraph three the intolerable living conditions of the planet Venus. Although the author has knowledge of these dangers, they claim that studying the Earth-like planet is worth it. In order to back up their claim, the author provides facts in the texts to convince the reader of the following: ""Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth. Today, Venus still has some features that are analogous to those on Earth."" This excerpt for example, may cause the reader to make inferences about other similarities between Earth and Venus, and would spark more interest in learning about Venus.

In addition to similar physical features, the author mentions how Venus is ""our nearest option for planetary visit, a crucial consideration given the long time frames of space travel."" This is a very vital fact, and significantly backs up the authors claim. Many planets and stars are several hundred light years away, making space travel and new discoveries by humans difficult. The closeness of Venus would allow humans to visit Venus, if there was a safe way to get there.

Leading off of the previous statement, The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has been formulating a solution to ""the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus... Imagine a blimp-like vehicle hovering 30 or so miles above the roiling Venusian landscape"". This would allow scientist to get extremely close to the surface of Venus, yet not close enough to gather samples from the planet itself.

The author of the article ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" suggests that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. The author was able to effectively support the idea that studying Venus is worth the risk, as it is the nearest planet to visit, as well as the idea of a blimp-like vehicle allowing close access to the planet to make new scientific discoveries. Despite the dangerous temperatures, and atmosphere composed of nearly 97 percent carbon dioxide, the author provided many examples as to why studying Venus is worth the risk to make new discoveries, and gather beneficial information about Earth's so- called ""twin"".",False
"The art of technology to read expression would be valuable for many reasons. Many people like to guss or are unaware of peoles feelings which could cause problem with communication. It alsp could stop some problemd not all but some.

With technology being that advanced to tell peoples felling it could defuse problems or keep them from happining. If someone is feeling sad or depressed and they are read from the computer it could tell a teacher to go help the kid out. By helping the kid or person it could keep tjat person from makig bad decisons. It could help out long term for those students. It could also help a teacher find out how to teach a specific subject the way thsts most beneficial to students. The computer reading emotions could help with that by letting the teacher know a kid is confused about something. A lot of time kids or people in generall don't like to ask for help about some things because it can be imbarrasing or they are just independent people but if they need help and dont ask the system could pick that up and inform the teacher. It could also make learning morre eifficant and interesting. Most people would want to know about how teachers are able to read emotions.",False
"My sister decided to be a doctor at a young age and started to focus on that path. Now, she is a doctor. Choosing which path should be taken in an early age and preparing for it beforehand, will help a lot for the future. Although some people might argue students should commit to a career later in their life, students should commit to a career at a young age because it helps them to decide for their future early, it makes them focus on a specific goal, and they won't feel more pressured to choose a career later in their life.

To begin critics say that choosing their occupation later in their life is more beneficial because they will be open to more new options later than in a young age. To support this idea, a child decided to be an engineer when s/he was young, but suddenly s/he changed his mind and decided to be a surgeon. Should s/he choose what s/he wants to be now or should s/he choose what s/he wanted to be when s/he was young? However, it is obvious that choosing a career later in their life will only make them feel burdensome and their life will only be more intricating.

A more valid argument is that choosing a path to be taken at a young age will let you have a better life in the future. For example, a girl started to prepare for the career she had chosen when she was young and started to work hard for that. Finally, her hard work paid off and acheived what she wanted to be. This evidence is valid because preparing for the career in a young will let your life go smoothly, will give more free time in the future, and won't feel pressurized.

Although people might say that students committing towards your career and choosing it at a young age will lead you to a better life because it makes them to focus on a certain goal of their life, will make them decide what they want for the future, and won't feel pressurized to choose their career. People should consider deciding their path in a young age for their own benefit and betterment. ",False

Why More Opinions is Better

I remember a time I went to go eat with my friends, before hand, I asked my brother for his experiences with the restaurant and if he recommends it. He then says ""yea, I recommend it, give it a shot"" We go to sit down, we all order our food, everyone having a great time. Except for me,

I had ordered the 'infamous' chicken noodle soup. The 'soup' tasted liked tap water, the 'chicken' tasted liked beef, and for the cherry on top, the noodle tasted liked plastic. We all head home after saying our goodbyes, by then, my brother had already left, so I tell my experience with my sister. She nods along and says ""yea, I ordered that one too, should've asked me if it the restaurant was good or not."" That is when I realized, it's always better to obtain more than one opinion, so you can get a view you or someone else didn't have, because everyone has different opinions and experiences, and so you can compare and differentiate two or more opinions to form your own opinion.

To start things off, you want to get a view you or someone you've talked to doesn't have. This will apply to mostly anything that has to do with needing an opinion, no one has the exact same outlook and or experiences. By asking more people for their opinion, it's like you're gaining knowledge your self, sparing you or simply saving you time it would take to experience first hand. Not only that, we're all in different positions, whether its in a debate, your favorite food, or your favorite videogame. Not everyone could or can relate to it, its important to gather more opinions on things so you have a stronger feel for it.

For my second reason is, we all have different opinions and experiences. This will mostly apply to anything that has to do will needing recommendations, what you need to know about getting a recommendation is, no one has the same taste. An example of this could be that you're really into videogames, however, on the contrary, your friends doesn't value videogames as much as you do. Asking him for an opinion, is the equivalent of asking a cat whats it's favorite sport is, not to say that his opinion doesn't matter, theres something for everyone. However it may not be as strong as someone else you know who is into games like you, this will help you get a stronger look on the recommended.

For my final reason on why multiple opinions are important is, to help you form your own opinion. This is most useful in debates or where there are two sides of the matter. If you only look from one opinion on one side, you are only getting one half on the situation, depending who you're talking to you may be only getting a quarter of the story. Its really important to get more than one opinion for this because you want to be factually correct, say you're writing an article of the political process and whether its good and effective, or bad and ineffective. If you only ask one person on why he thinks its good or bad, you will only get one half of it, and if you base your entire article on one source, it is, without a doubt, factually incorrect. Its especially important to seek more than one opinion because it will give you a stronger understanding of the matter.

In conclusion, it's always best to get as much opinions and inputs on the subject as possible, so you can get a view you or someone didn't have, because everyone has different opinion and experiences, and so you can compare and differentiate between two or more opinions to form your own opinion and outlook on the subject.",False
"You may wonder why you haven't seen people using their cars lately. This is because those citiznes have realized the advantages of limited car usage. There are many valid reasons why using a car is not the way to go when it comes to transportation.

In Elisabeth Rosenthal's article ""...Life Goes on Without Cars"" she talks to Heidrun Walter who has amited to the fact ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way,"" citizens become happier when they aren't using a car as a way of transportation. Life without cars can make you happier, isn't that what everyone want - to be happy? And this is just one way to do so.

There are more advantages to limited car usage than you think. We prevent smog ""Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after five-days of intensifying smog..."" We all hate how annoying smog can be, so all we have to do is the stop using cars as much and we won't see the thing we hate anymore. Even if you think that your city will only be prevented from smog, others will as well.

While there are disadvantages to the fact of not having a car, but isn't there more advantages to not having an Earth to live on? That's right, if we treat the Earth like we are now and using cars so much out ""home"" will be destroyed all thanks to humans like us. In Robert Duffer's article about smog bans he states ""After days of near-record pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city"", so if we take the example of Paris we can stop pollution and prevent losing our home.",False
"No more cars. Cars are one of the many problems of the world. It's slowly but steadly kill us or the world. Thats why i say no more cars.

If we were to get rid of carsall over the world we would have such a better enviorment. Wouldnt you want a better enviorment for you and the younger generation to see. One of the main things that is polluting our cities is gas. More perpheribly diesal. There are over a thousand  cars being driven in one city and all that gas that is used spreads to thye enviorment and causes deformation to our wild life. Many people dont realize that when diesal gas comes out of your exaust is a thick black smock that stays in that area for at least five minutes. Also when people get oil leaks they always say i'll get it checked tomorrow but never do and when they do get it checked the are leaking oil all over the street to get to the shop to get it fixed.

No more deaths would come of car accidents. Think about is every day you see something in the news about a car accident weather its car on car or someone being it by cars. cars cause alot of deaths in the world because people dont realize the amount of power they have and are always tring to impress. Hiting someone with your car expecially a child can scare a man for life because everyday when he gets in that car he is reminded of that day. Also think about all of the robberies. There wouldnt be much of that happening because they wouldnt be able to make a fast escame to get away with it. There is another thing solved by taking away cars, less criminals.

Less obese people would be living in the world because the wouldnt be able to get in their moterized vehicle to go to places. they would have to walk and even if there taking the train they are at least walking some where to get to that train. What if trains werent aloud either? You would definatly have less people over weight because they would be riding bikes or walking some where or if there late for something they wold run . Bogata has already made one hundred and eighteen miles of bicycle paths.

Birds cherping all over the city. Getting ride of cars would reduce the sound level and would allow wild life to come in to the cities. Wouldn't that be great, just wlking down the street minding your own buisness and you notice out of the corner of your eye a little doe, so elegant and piecefull as it walks down the street. I do know that not all animals are nice and friendly like bears and wolves but the occasional rare bird that flies past you on your way to work, wouldn't you rather see that than a cloud of black smoke come out of the exaust of the diesal truck infront of you. I know I would.

No more cars I say. No more. I want to see wildlife not smoke. I want to see a man that has lost one hundred pounds in the last year from riding his bike from place to place. Geting rid of cars is a great idea and some countries have already gotten the idea and I belive we should try it out.",False
"A world without cars is a world we should all want to live in. Participating in this worldwide fad has been known to benefit the lives of those among us. Thus, causing a decrease in the amount of stress one inhabits, as well as a decrease in pollution, and beneficial effects on carbon emissions. The advantages of limiting car usage are increasing daily, and cutting your time spent driving may have a positive effect on not only your life but your families, and those surrounded by you.

Traveling across the world to Germany, you will find Vauban. A well-known, upscale community where more and more soccer moms and commuting executives are giving up their cars. This experimental, new district has generally forebidden street parking, driveways, and home garages. Therefore seventy percent of the residents in this community do not have cars, and fifty-seven percent sold a car to move to this ecofriendly habitat. One resident, Heidrun Walter says, ""When I had a car, I was always tense, I'm much happier now."" The atomosphere of this residence has a positive effect on stress, meaning it decreases it! The vibe of walking down a street filled with the swish of bicycles passing by, and the chatter of wandering children has lowered the stress of nearly all residents. This ecofriendly, and stress-free enviroment is a trend that is growing and being adopted by many countries, including the U.S. From Chicago to Shanghai, this residential area may be the place for you.

Paris, France, home to the famous Eiffel Tower even has its pollution problems. After days of uncontrollable smog, the ruling French party enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of thiis well-known city. They ruled that on Monday's even-numbered license plates were ordered to leave their vehicles at home, and on Tuesdays, odd-numbered license plates were to do so as well. After this first trial, the congestion was down sixty percent in the capital of France. This was a huge success since Paris typically has more pollution that other European capitals. Temporary laws like this have a huge effect on reducing the amount of pollution in crowded cities. Even the city of love has unclean air, how romantic is that? Limiting the usage of cars benefited this society immensely, and it could benefit our world as a whole if all of us chose to cut back our car usage at least twice a week.

Automobiles are the Beyonce of suburbs, where families from California all the way to Sydney tend to make their homes. Experts have concluded that this is a huge impediment to current efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from tailpipes all around the world. Passenger cars in Europe are only responsible for twelve percent of these emissions, while America is responsible for up to fifty percent. President Obama's goals to drastically curb these greenhouse gas emissions will be assisted by a shift in American behavior: Fewer Americans getting their license. Studies have shown less and less of Americas youth are prioritizing getting their license. If this pattern persists, it will have a beneficial effect on the reduction of carbon emissions being released into the environment. This calls for less pollution, and a more ecofriendly, healthy society for us all.

In conclusion, limiting car usage in your daily life can cause a drastic change. These changes include a decrease in the amount of stress one inhabits, to less pollution, and a beneficial effect on carbon emissions. Our society as a whole has the opportunity to reduce car usage, so why not grab it while we have the chance. A healthier environment calls for a healthier you.",False
"Dear Reader,

Good Afternoon, You may know me as Dr. Ema R. I'm Head Scientist down at NASA. So today I'm going to tell you about the 'Face on Mars' some people think its just a funky looking rock. Well my friends they are wrong. Now your going to move on to my studying and research I have done to find out what it is and I'm pretty sure I found the right answer.

The 'Face on Mars' was found by us NASA, in 1976. It got very popular over the years then. By popular I mean appearing in a Hollywood film, books, magazines, radio, and even talk shows. Now, I know what your thinking. What was so popular about a landform on a planet other than ours? Well first, its not a landform, and second lets be completly honest here, if you were looking through a telescope and saw a face in the sky what would you do? You wouldn't shake it off and go to bed. At least I wouldn't, I would be showing it to everyone and try to turn it into NASA because you would be a hero for maybe finding life on another planet.

What I think about this 'Face' is very important to the people that work with me in the lab. When they find something they bring it to me and see my opion so they can go look to see if I'm right, I mean I always am. Anyways, I would like to share with everyone here aboout my opionon on this, when the lab workers first came and told me about it I thought that they were nuts, like really a face in the sky guys? Until, one night I was working late in the lab trying to find out what this whole thing is about so I went out to the sky room to look through the telescope. I was zooming until I found Mars, I was searching through the planet and saw the 'Face' and it indeed looked like a face. I searched for more, then thats when I put my research to work.

During that time of reasearch I found out a lot of things. In my lab I didn't do much work on Mars itself It was mainly, Saturn and Jupiter. The work I did on Mars made me think that we aren't the only planet with life. This 'Face' isn't a landform, its a lifeform. Thats when my research was finished and I talked to my boss about what I thought, he told me to anouce it to my lab crew and see what else we could find out. I made my lab crew stay after hours to see if we could possibly find more lifeforms. Let me tell you a few more things, the reason I thought it was a lifeform is thats what all the faces on Mars, if there is life, look like. When life on Mars dies they will bury them like we do.

Also, the way this 'Face' appeared there when it was buried. It got buried there forever ago and now the skull is popping up. So now the Space crew turned the Mars rover into an investagator if thats what you want to call it. The leaders would put it into motion and try to find more life forms or signs of life. Maybe these forms there, don't need to live with water and oxygen like we do they may just have to live off of sunlight or dirt maybe something crazy like that. NASA will one day find more evidence of lights on other planets.

I would like to thank you for reading my article, please if you think you have information about the 'Face' or other planets, contact us NASA on our website, www. NASA.com which also has an info hotline for you to learn more, and our Captains email. Thank You, once again.

Sincerely,

Dr. Ema R.

"NASA has discovered many incredible supernatural things, but they do not believe any of these situations was caused by the existance of aliens. I do not believe that the Face was caused by aliens.

First of all, the Face does not signify a statue or proof of alien existance. In paragraph 7, the text clearly states, "" There was no alien monument after all.""

This means that aliens could not have created the Face as a signification or monument to proof thier existance.

Second, the Face is a landform. The Face looks more a landform that could have caused by the harsh weather on Mars. In paragraph 12, the text clearly states,""What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa-landforms that are common around the American West."" The author also states in the text,"" It reminds me mostly of the Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain in Idaho."" This means that the Face was a landforms caused by its location on Mars.

CA: Aliens could have made the Face as a siblimal message. They could not have because there is not any evidence that aliens did it. The Face is in the north part of Mars and that is a lava dome that takes form of an isolated mesa.

In conclusion, aliens did not cause the Face on Mars because it is a land form caused by the weather on Mars. If aliens caused the Face on Mars it could have a been more evidence of their existance, and the Face would not look more of a landform. Otherwise, I do not believe the face was caused by aliens, more so of a landform.",False
"Senator, I believe that voting for the president of the United States should be based off of the popular vote by the people. Not the Electoral College. Voting by the Electoral College does not allow the people to have the final say. It ultimately gives the elector the choice. ""The 2000 fiasco was the biggest election crisis in a century"" Bradford Plumer, paragraph 14, it was a disaster factor. The electors went against the will of the people and voted the opposite of what they said. Whose to say something like this can't happen again soon?

Some people say that the Electoral College is a good thing. It allows a certainty of outcome and is a fair, reasonable way to vote for a president. But it is based off of trust, that the elector won't betray the candidate's party and people. Trust. Are you really going to put your vote for the president of your country in someone else hand based off of trust?

Having an elector represent your state based off of population is ridiculous. One elector representing 500,000 people in Wyoming. Wouldn't you sleep better at night if you could represent yourself instead of someone representing you and thousands of other people all at once.

In 2000, a candidate had more popular votes, and less electoral votes and lost! Even though the people had more votes! How do you feel knowing that your vote doesn't even count? ""Most states have a winnertakeall' system that awards all electors to the winning presidential candidate""the Office of the Federal Register,paragraph 7. Because of this system, candidates will not spend time in certain states they know they have no chance in winning in. ""During the 2000 campaign seventeen states didn't see the candidates at all""Bradford Plumer, paragraph 13 Next time you go into that voting booth, remember that you're not voting for a president, you're voting and are supposed to trust an elector.",False
"The author supports the idea that Venus is worthy to pursuit despite the dangers by telling us several things. That this is our neighboring planet, by showing us that we need to expand ourselves and explore, and by telling us that Venus is as close as a sister planet could come to Earth.

One reason the author tells us we should examine Venus further is by telling us how close this planet is to us. Venus, like Mars, is our neighboring planet. In the text, it says ""These differences in speed mean that sometimes we are closer to Mars and other times to Venus."" Since Venus is so close, the author tells us that we should be exploring it. Another piece of text evidence is ""Because Venus is sometimes right around the cornerin space terms..."" The author tells us again how close Venus is to us. The risk here includes getting a shuttle close enough that could be of help to us. ""More importantly, researchers cannot take samples of rock, gas, or anything else, from a distance."" This evidence tells us that even if we were to get close to Venus, we couldn't take samples with our technology the way it is now. We would have to develope better technology. This evidence further shows how the author thinks that it is worthy to pursuit Venus, despite the dangers.

Another reason the author implores us to keep exploring Venus despite the risks is that we need to expand our horizons beyond one planet. The author supports this in his concluding sentence ""Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation."" This shows how the author wants to push on rather than to simply settle where we are, despite the risks. The author also states how exploring another planet would help further understanding on Earth as well; ""Striving to meet the challenge presented by Venus has value, not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors."" The author is saying that if we don't explore Venus now, what will we do in similar situations when the oppurtunity presents itself? To sum up this paragraph, the author supports the idea that we should examine Venus despite the risks by showing Earth needs to expand its horizons.

The third reason why the author wants us to explore Venus is that it has come as close as any planet in our solar system to Earth. In the article, the author calls Venus our twin or our ""sister planet"" what he means by this is that Venus was once very similar to Earth. In the text, it says ""Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth."" The author tells us that Venus could have supported life at one point. Another piece of textual evidence is ""Furthermore, recall that Venus can sometimes be our nearest option for a planetary visit, a crucial consideration given the long time frames of space travel. The value of returning to Venus seems indisputable,"" the author shows us that Venus would be a prime target to try and explore because of how close it is to Earth. The author is explaining that Venus, being so close, could potentially have alot of crucial information about life.

To conclude this essay, the author supports the idea that we should explore Venus, despite the risks in three ways. By telling us that Venus is our neighboring planet, by showing that we need to expand ourselves and explore, and by telling us that Venus is as close as a sister planet could come. These reasons are how the author supported his idea.",False
the author suggests that studying venus is worthy pursuit despite the danger. i think he did good on support the story abouts why it worthy but it might not be worthy it might just be that all the spaceship they was using or the stuff on the ship making it not able to make it all the way up there they could be making the spaceship to havey or they need to study somewhere else first just to see if the ship the reason why the cant make it there and back. i think they should try a new ship or try to make it to somewhere else before trying to make it over there try somewhere closer so than maybe you find out how to get there or mybad get close to get to there that just how i see it if you say it worthy than try a diffent plant just to see if it easy to find out how to get to that plant you been talking about that why when u pull up all the reseach you can say as i was reach i find two way to get to the plant and they gone say how u find all of that to go with that and say when u find stuff you can get stuff from it.,False
"The Facial Action Coding System is valuable to have in a classroom. This is a great idea because if a student is lost or confused about the class or work they're doing, this computer detects it and the teacher would help. In the other hand I think most people would not like this idea because this computer would know everything and how a person might be feeling, not everybody likes to tell people what they feel at the moment. The Facial Action Coding System can be the same technology to make computer-animated faces more expressive, for video games and video surgery. Also humman communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication. Meanwhile they also use muscles to show espression. Sometimes teachers know how you feel if they know you for a while the face expressions they make. Some people just don't even make expressions they always have a serious face on and people that you have known for a long time such as friends, familiy ect. You know them and if something is wrong you will let them know. This computer software stores similar anatomical information as electronic code. Also a cool idea to see how the students feel thst day for class, everyone shpuld be happy. The theory of emotion moving your facial mucsles not only expresses emotions.",False
"In the article ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" it show that the author likes to study Venus because it is like earths ""twin"". the earth can be dangerous but worth learning about. the earth can be livaible for humans with harsh conditons. not knowing what we can have without trying cannot be the right choice.

Venus is called earth's twin becaue as in the text it states ""Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms to density and size, and occasionally the closet in distance too.""(paragraph 2). we know we have a planet that is like earth can be one of the most exciting thing to know. we can survive on another earth is another.

If we were to ever go to venus we will be able to live there but with harsh conditions. As in the texts states ""on the planet's surface, tempertaures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmosheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we have experience on out own planet."" (paragraph3). normal weather to Venus is nothing compared to our earth. although they are alike.

Going to Venus would be dangerous but in realtiy if we don't go and study our earths twin we might not ever have the knowlege we can have by going. in the article it states ""The value of returning to Venus seems indispoutalde, but what are the options for making such a mission both safe and scientifically productive.""(paragraph 4). if we don't try we won't learn anything new about what we don't have.

Having a earth as similar to earth can be exicting when it comes to studing it. going to a diferent planet with different condtions unlike ours can be dangerous also, not know what could have been known is a tough disicion.",False
"In ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" the author encourages humanity to rise up above the obstacles that have stopped us from exploring Venus in the past, and push forward into uncharted territory. He cites several reasons why humans might want to explore a planet with such harsh and unforgiving conditions, and he gives examples of solutions to the problems that these conditions cause. He uses compelling evidence and inspiring diction to support his claim that humanity should work towards exploring Venus. He supports this claim very well. One example of the evidence that he uses to support his claim is the fact that Venus bears many similarities to Earth, making it valuable in scientific reasearch. In paragraph four he writes: ""Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system."" He follows this up by explaining that gathering information about Venus could very well provide us with valuable information about our own planet; Earth. The author uses this evidence as the main reason that scientists would benefit from exploring the surface of Venus. One problem that the author encounters is the extremity of the conditions on Venus. However, he offers solutions to this problem later in the article, when he provides information on how NASA would combat the dangerous conditions on the surface and explore Venus without any harm coming to the people involved. In paragraph five he writes; ""NASA's possible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus would allow scientists to float above the fray. Imagine a blimp-like vehicle hovering 30 or so miles above the Venusian surface."" The author includes this example of a solution for the harsh conditions of Venus to compell the reader towards believing that exploring Venus would be a valuable use of time and effort for human civilization, due to the fact that it is not only rich with information that could help us explain our own lives on Earth, but also because on the surface of Venus could collect this information without having to risk the safety of the explorers that are involved. This is a powerful use of evidence, because it provides examples of why we should attempt to explore Venus, and it then works towards removing our doubt of this claim by giving us evidence that the risks that would be faced on Venus could be reduced significantly. In conclusion; the author's claim that humanity would benefit greatly from travelling to and exploring Venus is well supported, with both evidence that supports the idea that the information that we would gain would be valuable to us, and evidence that the risks that we would have to take would be small enough to ensure the safety of the people involved. The author inspires us to look beyond what we have at the moment and strive for a better future; one where we can become a multi-planetary civilization that has the ability to explore other planets and, perhaps, other stars.",False
"When seeking advice, people often ask more than one person; they do this to receive multiple opinions on the advice. People ask multiple opinions for many reasons, but here are a few. Some of the benefits, of seeking different opinions, are that you will get more accurate advice, you will get more perspectives on advice, and you will receive advice that you can trust.

First, when you get multiple opinions, you will get more accurate advice. Asking one person their opinion could give you wrong information, but by asking multiple people you are more likely to get more accurate advice. Some people have more knowledge or experience on the topic than others: it would be better to ask them for advice. For example, it would be more beneficial to ask a basketball player for advice about basketball, rather than someone who has never played the sport. Doing this will give you the most accurate advice.

Next, by asking more than one person for advice, you will get more perspectives on the advice. If you ask someone for advice from one person they may only look at it from one perspective , but asking many people you will get many different perspectives. An example would be if you asked one person their advice and then asked another person their advice. They may both give accurate views, but each have completely different views on the advice. So by asking both of them their perspectives, you can use both opinions to make the decision that will be most beneficial.

Lastly, you will get trustworthy opinions. If you ask a peer or someone that is untrustworthy, they might give you incorrect advice purposefully to be unkind. That happens quite often in schools. A peer may tell you advice to get you into trouble or cause you to look unintelligent. It is better to receive advice from many people to make sure that the information you are advice is true. That way if the advice is untrue you can not use the advice.

When looking for advice, you should ask multiple peoples opinions. Asking multiple people for advice will give the most accurate advice, give many perspectives on the advice, and give you the most trustworthy advice. Also you should seek advice from people with experience, people with different perspectives, and people that you trust. Doing this will cause the decision that you make to be the most accurate, the most beneficial, and make the better choice.",False
"When I was just learning how to play soccer I couldn't kick the ball correctly. Every single time I tried to my foot would slide under the ball causing the ball to go straight up in the air. Due to that disheartening fact I tended to get made fun of.....ALOT. I mean who can't kick a soccer ball correctly. So the best way I saw fit to help fix the problem at hand, was to ask the coach, my dad, and my best friend for advice. That would hopefully help me kick the ball better. So one thing I think is very important to help anybody learn is to ask more than one person for advice that in the future can help guide you into making better choices.

The number one person I confide in, if I ever have any kind of issue is my dad. He honestly is my rock. So as the situation arose. He was the first person I was going to talk to. So later that afternoon we walked outside and grabbed a ball. He watched me kick the ball about ten to twelve times. And, as I was doing this he never once laughed or judged me instead he gave me a helping hand and tried to help me work though the problem. Eventually he told me to stop and helped explain to me that my planter foot was not in the right place when I kicked the ball. So naturally, I asked him what the planter foot was and he patiently and carefully explained to me that the planter foot helped guide the ball to were it is supposed to go. That it was, the foot next to the soccer ball. Sadly try as I might his solution helped but didn't fix the problem as a whole. So as I walked back inside I started to plan who was the next best person that could help me solve the issue.

So the next stop in my quest to improve my kick, was my coach. As much as my father's advice had helped my kick the ball it still did not fix it. So as time when on I knew I was letting down my team by not being able to really kick the soccer ball. So the next time we had practice I emailed the coach and asked him to come fifteen minutes early to see if he could help with the pressing issue. Again he listened to my issue with interest and politely asked me to kick the ball so he could watch the way I kicked it to help detect the problem. So after about five minutes of watching me kick the ball he asked me if I could just do my run up to the ball but not kick it. So I did, the next thing he said surprised me, he told me that I was not running up to the ball correctly. Instead of coming to the ball from an angle to the kick the ball, I was standing right behind it and then trying to kick it. So just like the last time I started to use his method to see if that would help. In the end it made my kick stronger but it still was going straight up. So just as before, I sucked it up and started to think of the next person I could ask.

By then I could feel myself losing hope there was only one more person I felt like I could turn to who would not laugh at me because I could not kick a soccer ball. So the next day at school I went up to a girl named Generic_Name. She was my best friend and lucky for me she was one of the best girls on the soccer team. So as quietly as I could, so no one would here me, I asked her for help. Luckily she said that she was free after school and that we could meet up at her place to help work on the problem. So later that day I stood in her backyard with little to no hope. Her approach however was different from both the coach and my dad. She went though each step of kicking a soccer ball correctly and which situation calls for how much power, where you kick the ball, and what part of the foot you kick it with. So after a long explanation she asked me to show her the way I kick the ball. Of course even after all that the ball still went up in the air, I groaned. Then she stood up quietly and pointed to my foot and said, ""There.""

The place were I was gong wrong was which part of the foot I was kicking the ball with. I was trying to toe ball it the entire time. When in reality I needed to kick the ball with my laces. So I scurried off and went to look for another soccer ball. The next time I kicked the ball I made sure to kick it with my laces. I couldn't believe my eyes the ball went straight instead of up. I was super happy I ran over to her and gave her a huge hug. The next this thing Generic_Name said was, ""Don't thank just me, thank the people who got you to this point,"" of course as always she was right.

In the end I learned a valuable lesson for the problem, Which were advantages to asking more then one person for advice. Without the help from my dad, the coach, and of course Generic_Name, I wold have never been able to get there in the first place. After that I started to really understand the advantages of asking more than one person for advice. Without there advice I very might well have ended up quitting the sport that I now love. So without a doubt I think that asking more then one person will benefit you a lot more then asking just one person for advice to a problem. So the next time you feel like there is no one to turn to, or that no one else has faced the problem you are facing. Understand the possibilities that you may be giving away by not asking for advice from more then one person.",False
"Recently we have discovered a new landform on Mars. Viking 1 caught a picture of a martian mesa, these are very common. These martian mesas are similar to the ones on Earth. They are very common in Cydonia, a region on Mars. Many conspiracy therorists are saying that it was constructed by aliens, but from the evidence we have, this is not true.

The picture taken by Viking 1 showed a large mesa-like landform with the face an Egyptian god on it. Everything can be explained in the picture. The landform is like any other one. The reason it looks like a face is because shadows were being cast onto it to make it appear like it had eyes, a mouth and a nose.

In 1998, a camera captured another picture of the formation. It was a little cloudy on the day they took the picture, so we went again to capture another picture. This time in April of 2001, we used a much better camera and used maximum resolution. This picture was much more detailed and clear. Once we zoomed in it looked like any other landform we might find. In paragraph 11 Garvin states, ¨So, if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks you could see them!¨ He was correct this picture proves that there is no alien activity near this landoform.

In conclusion, it is clear that the ¨Face on Mars¨ wasn´t created by aliens. We took a much more defined picture and found nothing. Not to metion the fact that there is no water on Mars, so it can´t support life. Very very few of the scientists beleive that this was created by aliens. Everything can be explained by science in this picture.",False
"Would you like if your emotions are being detected withouht your consetiment? Technology is every day beging more capable of new things, in terms of artificial intelligenece. The new software has been developled so that it can read or decode the emotions of others.

It is important to know how the muscles in our body , in our face works , and what an amazing way to know through technology. But at the point to that technology knows what are your emotions to then use them on ""what you need"" is not correct. I am not saying that when we want to search about emotions through technology there should not be anything on it.

"Decisions are a big deal but how do you know you are making the right decisions? others can help a lot by giving you advice but you also always need to make sure that you are talking to the right people and make sure they are giving the best advice to you.

Asking for advice is always a great idea if you are stuck with a decision.

first of all, you have a better chance of making the better decision when asking others for advice on your decision. When you only ask one person you only have one piece of advice but when you ask multiple people you have multiple ideas like if you ask three people fro advice and one person says one thing and then the other two have the same idea then you would go with the two people with the same idea because they have the advice that the majority agreed on. you also get way more support when asking multiple people because they all want to help out with the decisions you make. People will also push you to make the right decision when you are making big decisions like choosing your classes or what car you want to get.

Another big one is the people you talk to about your decisions. Teachers are really helpful when it comes to making the right choices because they are with you very often and are very nice and supportive. Parents, siblings, and other family members are also very good for your choices because they are always very supportive of you no matter what. Friends are another big one because they are your friends so they are always there for you no matter what, at school at home they always support you.

those two reasons are why asking multiple people for some help on choices is a smart thing to do.",False
"Teaching in a classroom setting is something that has been happening sucessfully for centuries now, dating way way back before technology was even being thought about. This goes to show technolgoy is not needed, but maybe sonetimes helpful. In a classroom setting peices of technology such has things like computers can be super helpful when doing things such as writing an essay, and acessing information online, however when taken too advancely it can become more of a joke, and a distraction to students. That's where the Facial Action Coding System comes into play. The Facial Action Coding System theoretically seems to be a good idea but in reality it's an expensive toy. There are many other proven effective ways to teach in a classroom, and somethings are boring to learn about but you still have to know them, so just sit still, relax, and learn.

The first thing you notice when walking into a classroom is usually the students who are choosing not to spend their time wisely rather than the students who are. This is because students who choose be off task are often distracted by technolgy and gaming which is a lot more noticable to the human eye. These students are taking advantage of technology provided and using it for bad. So why would we put the Facial Action Coding System in schools when it is expensive and would be used as a toy? That's right, we wouldnt. When used for other purposes we also risk crashing which is another thing that would take up more time rather than taking that time for the students to be taught.

Everybody learns in differnt ways for example take the idea of studying for a spelling test. Some kids learn by writing it down multiple times, some kids learn by hearing it being spelled, others learn best by repeating it. There are so many way for kids to learn so by adding the Facial Action Coding System into schools you're assessing kids on how much they enjoy what they are learning about, and not how much information they are actually gaining. Which bring me to my next point.

Not every kid is going to be excited about everything they learn. Yes, some books are boring, and who wants to learn about what cells are made of, and who cares who invented the lightbulb, but these are all things kids are going to learn anyways. Not everything is going to be fun. sometimes you just need the facts. Making kids excited about a topic all comes from the influences of other people being excited about a topic and feeling that positive energy around them. If a computer screen told you you were bored, it wouldn't make you less bored.

The Facial Action Coding System is not all bad. There are some good parts about it. In the pasage the author talks about how ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored."" To recognize when a student is confused is a powerful thing, because when more students are confused they don't always like to say it, however the Facial Action Coding System is an expesive way to tell if a student is confused. If a child is confused they should say something. This allows students to build up self-confidence. All in all the Facial Action Coding System has both pros and cons, however the cons over power the pros making this tool not valuable in a classroom setting. It is an expensive toy that should be used for other purposes. Not to say there is no good uses for the Facial Action Coding System, but it is just not valueable in a classroom setting.",False
"Its a fact that possitive actitude is the key of succses. In every single thinsg that you made, or every single act that you take, even a small ane like blink if you are not confident in what you are doing, on that i will make it fealling, you will be failing.

That does not mean that fealing is a bad thing because fealing is a important aspec of successes. Not only because you will learn from the mistakes that led you to the failing box. But also you will come back knowing against what you are figthig with, next time you will be back with a diferent set of mind, with a diferent plan, even with a diferent actittude, and all that because one thing wich all the people says is bad.''Fail''.

but lets be honest, why would somebody fail if you have the chace to be successfull ?, because if you are not going to win and get what you want and are looking for, do not even struggle, stay at home laying donw and watching some series. There is a real hungry world with real hungry people out there and if you are just giving the 75 percent it of your capacity it would be just not enougth.

Thats were positive actittude comes up, if you know your value and you are wheling to give the one hundred percent you dont have to worry.

If you are confident and positive you will go for what you are looking fof do not matter who is agaist you, do not matter what the people would say and specially it do not matter the cost of it. That is the key of success.",False
"I think the technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable. The Facial Action Coding System (FACS) can prove how a person is feeling due to having a 3-D computer model, an electronic code, and a facial software.

First, the FACS has a 3-D computer model to help it figure out a persons emotion. In the text it says, ""all 44 major muscles in the model must move like a humans muscles."" This evidence shows that a humans facial muscles shows how a person is feeling and each emotion has their own charateristics.

Second, the FACS also has an electronic code which helps the system understand better the emotion just kanda how us as humans can tell if our friend is upset or happy. For example in the text it says, ""His new computer software stores similar anatomical information as electronic code."" This evidence shows that the software has the same kind of thing that lets us humans know how our friend is feeling.

Lastly, the facial software helps FACS by using human features on the face understand the emotions. In the article it says, ""muscles called orbicularis oculi palpabraeus makes crow's-feet around your eyes. But in a false smile, the mouth is stretched sideways using the zygomatic major and a different muscle, the risorius."" This evidence shows that even a computer software can tell what you're feeling by your face features.

I think the FACS should be used to read the emotion expressions of students in a classroom. Having a 3-D computer model, an electonic code, and a facial software sure can all help Facial Action Coding System recongize a humans emotion.",False
"The advantages of limiting car usage is that many people needs a car for certain reasons and some may not because they would rather walk, take the bus, or may ride their bikes. Having a car may come in handy to some people because they are organize to have summer jobs and have social life around where they can walk and take public transportation or may even car pool with friends. People who do live in cities often take the bus, walk, and cabs if needed to.

Not all have cars in big cities because it cost more for gas and some probably can't drive. Since driving is becoming more big in life more teenagers and young adults are driving more often. Living in the suburbs you'll will need to drive because everything isn't close by each other it's more distance so maybe you'll probably have to walk or may ride a bike to get where your trying to go.

""With all these changes people who stopped car commuting as a result of the recession may find less reason to resume the habbit.""  Well because they may feel that having something to do with a car may cost them alot. Not alot of people can afford cars and what the car needs for it to work properly instuff. People who did have a car were always intense because they never knew what can happen with the car.

Transportantion for America is a fast growing coalition of hundreds of groups in the United States. They want people in the community that live in the suburbs to pay more because using a car cost more than living in cities in that when your living in the cities you really wouldn't have that much to do because it's walking distance.

If your living on an island you probably wouldn't need a car that much because everything is like near or to close. Having a car on a island isn't really much needed to be honest you would barely use it which would be a waste of money for half of the stuff you may use to get on the car.",False
"There is minimal evidence to prove that the Face was actually created by aliens. However, there is evidence to back up the claim that the Face is just a natural landform. Landforms such as this exist on Earth and high-quality images have been taken showing a normal landform on the surface of Mars.

One reason we know the Face was not created by aliens is because of it's similarities to landforms on earth. The Face is ""the Martian equivalent"" of landforms common to the American West called mesas. Jim Garvin, chief scientist for NASA's Mars Exploration Program, commented on the similarities. ""It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho...That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars."" The fact that the Face resembles a natural landform here on Earth supports the idea of the Face also being a natural landform.

Not only does the Face have similarities to natural landforms on Earth, higher quality pictures of it have been taken since 1976. In 1998, the Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia where the Face was located. Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera team ""snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original image"". The photo was uploaded to a JPL web site where thousands were waiting for a picture. A natural landform was revealed. ""There was no alien monument after all"".

Some people, however, were not convinced. ""Perhaps, said skeptics, alien markings were hidden by a haze."" People believed the clouds had blocked the view of ""alien markings"". In 2001, on a ""cloudless summer day"". Mars Global Surveyor got another look. The photo was taken in maxium resolution. ""Each pixels in the 2001 images spans 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo.""

Earth similarities and high-quality images can support the claim that the Face was not created by aliens. The Face is simply a natural landform, not an alien creation.",False
"What if your teacher could actually know exactly how you are feeling? I think the use of a new technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom would be very valuable, due to the fact that they could give a teacher more insight on how their students really feel, and even let a student know that they are not the only ones who might feel the way they do. Finally, this technology could help modify lessons and increase student productivity.

This technology could give teachers more insight on how their students really feel due to its extroardinary system. Paragraph 3 talks about how the process begins, cause the big question here might be, "" Can you actually ""calculate"" emotions- like math problems?"" Or, ""How can a computer recognize the subtle facial movements we humans use to express how we feel?"" The text states how the process includes constructing a 3-D computer model of the face and how with the work of physhologists the emotions can be defined. If this system is as valauable as the text states it to be, then letting a teacher know how the students actually feel could be effecient to the the teacher, because they can try to comprehend the students and show their support to them as well. Nowadays teachers seem to think that they are the only ones with problems which is not at all true.

This technology could also be of value if it even lead to letting classmates know that they are not the only ones dealing with the emotions that they have, in fact many others could feel the exact way. Sometimes students feel that they are dealing with emotions alone. This technology could change that. Letting other students know of how a class mate is feeling could be very helpful. Not obly that, but knowing or seeing that others are happy could bring a smile to your face. Paragraph 6 states, ""The Mona Lisa demonstration is really intended to bring a smile to your face, while it just shows how much this computer can do."" The capability of this technology just sounds like it can change lives.

The classroom computer could also help to modify a lesson if a student is bored. The text states, "" A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored."" ""Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" This could improve productivity.

The Facial Action Coding System could be very valuable in a classroom, due to such a great software it uses. This sytem could impact not only a classroom, but lives.",False
"The author of ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" suggests studying Venus is a hopeful endevor despite the danger it presents, its both terrifying and wonderous how Venus mirrors what Earth would have looked like if it was closer to the sun. Venus is the most unexplored planet in the solar system, less than the Earth's oceans.

Venus could give us reason to develop new technology to last longer on its surface: ""Some simplified electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of Venus's surface and have lasted for three weeks."" We human beings tested silicon carbide electronics in a chamber simulating Venus's surface and it lasted three weeks before it was finally broken down by the chaotic conditions.

Venus is a worthy pursuit, a dangerous one, but worthy. If we do not try, then we might as well give up everything we accomplished to an incinerater and just sit on the couch doing nothing and wasting precious time.",False
"In the excerpt, ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" The author does not support their idea that Venus is a worthy pursuit, despite the dangers it presents, all to well, they start off by listing several details that correspond with the exploration of the planet. Such as details of the physical state of the planet in correlation to Earth, but then list the dangers of Venus itself, plans that are backed by science to give human life a CHANCE, but not ideal living conditions on the planet.

To begin, The author starts off supporting their idea of Venus being worthy of exploring by writing about how Venus is somewhat similar to Earth, in the physical aspects, they state the Venus is often referred to ""Earth's Twin, Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of density and size."" They describe how long ago Venus was, ""Covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like earth,"" but they do not mention or go into detail as to what happened to the lakes, as a reader I'm curious as to what happened to the planet, and why it is the way it is today. The author also incorporates a description of the landscape on Venus, they write, ""The planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as Valleys, Mountains, and Craters,"" the description of the landscape sounds interesting because it is being described sort of like the Grand Canyon, because of the mountains, valleys, and other physical aspects.

Furthermore, the author begins to dive into to the several dangers that go with exploring Venus, they describe the atmosphere as, ""Almost 97 percent carbon dioxide."" In my opinion a world with an atmosphere of 97 percent carbon dioxide does not sound like the most fun thing. Also being described by the author are the clouds that coat the planet and are filled with, ""Highly corrosive sulfuric acid,"" to me as a reader this sounds more like a death wish rather than a ""worthy pursuit.""

More dangers that the author lists, is the temperature and the atmospheric pressure. ""Temperatures average over 800 degrees Farenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times higher than what we experience on our own planet. these conditions are far more extreme than anything humans encounter on Earth; such an enviroment would crush even a submarineaccustomed to diving to the deepest parts of our oceans, and liquefy many metals."" Those few sentences do not support the claim and idea made by the author that it would be a worthy pursuit. along with blazing temperatures and crushing pressure come with, ""erupting bolcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lightening strikes to probes seeking to land on its surface.""

Next, the author continues their ideas with a plan made by NASA, where scientists would ""explore"" by living in a blimp-like structure that hovers about 30 miles above the planets surface. Even 30 miles above the ""temperatures would still be toasty at around 170 degrees Farenheit, but the air pressure would be close the that of sea leavel on Earth. Solar power would be plentiful, and radiation would not exceed Earth levels. Not easy conditions but, survivable for humans."" Being in the blimp hovering above the planet would be pointless due to the atmosphere being so dense that most forms of light cannot penetrate it. also stated by the author is, ""More importantly, reasearchers cannot take samples of rock, gas, or anything else, from a distance."" However, the author states that NASA is working on taking different approaches to studying the planet by using, ""Technology called mechanical computers....these devices played an important role in the 1940s during World War II.""

Lastly, the author does not support his/her ideas of ,""Venus being worth of pursuit despite the dangers it presents,"" the author does list several benefits and interesting facts of exploring the planet, but unfortunatly in my opinion the dangers greatly outweigh the risks in physically being on the planet. Now if they conveyed exploring the planet from a far, and with robots and not actual people then I would be all for it.",False
"When older student work with smaller students, it can make friends, it can also help smaller student and older student.

When older student and smaller student work together it can make friends because both student have to work together so they have to listen and talk to each other, so they can be friends. When they talk to each other they can learn more about the other person like they can know what they like or what they don't like. So they can learn a lot from each other. It mean that when you make friend it can help the smaller kids.

It can help the smaller kid because they can uderstand better about the lesson because they know then if they don't understand something someone is gonna to help them to understand. They can say their opinion because ththe older and smaller student do not have a lot of different age like could have 4 or 5 years old more then tem so that is not a lot, so it can be easyer to the small kid to explain you what their opinion is. They can also ask a question when they want because sormely they have to wait that the teacher is finish an other student to ask the question but if there are also older student which alredy do the lesso you can ask them your question. The work by different age help the small kid but it can also help the old kid.

It can help the old kid because it help them to stay calm to do not be in stress, because with small kid you have to dpeak slow and do not be angry because they do not understand you are saying. If they understand what you are saying it mean that you have to find an other way to explain it like speak cleerly with simple words because don't know all the long and difficult word. The older student have maby forget this lesson so they can relearn the less at the same time then the small kids, but it will be easyer for the older student because he will remenber quicly. So when the small and big kid work together it can creat benefits and it can help the both of the student.

So when older student work with smaller students, it can make friends, it can also help smaller student and older student. So I realy think it is importante for the small and old kid to work together, because they both have benefits to do it.                ",False
"People arent using cars as much because it is not worth their time. It is easier for them to just jump on a bus or walk or bike to their destination. Places that dont use cars are having a better life because people are not as stressed and there isnt nearly as much pollution. ""When i had a car i was always tense. im much happier this way"". other countries are getting in on the ""car reduced"" comunities.

In Paris they ban driving because of all the smog in the city. they would fine people who did drive on those days and depending on how people reacted their cars would be impounded. people were just using public transportation and by the next few days the smog was gone.

In bogota, colombia they have had a ""car free"" day for the past three years where people walk to work or school or take public trasportation. ""its a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution"". and for the first time two other colombian cities, cali and valledupar, joined the event. many people have gone car free for a long time instead of just a day. they just use bikes or public transportation because it is easier and less stressful.

In the united states people have been driving less adn getting fewer licenses as the years progress. the number of miles driven per person in 2013 was the same as it was in 1995. the renewal of center cities has made the suburbs less appealing and has drawn empty nesters back in. likewise the rise in cellphones and car-pooling apps has facilitated more flexible commuting arrangements, including the evolution of shared van services for getting to work. in new york there is a bike sharing program that is really taking off. and the tolls on bridges and tunnels are making people drive less and less. there has also been a large drop in percentage of sixteen to thirtynine year olds getting licenses.",False
"The Author supports the idea of studying venus. In paragraph 2, ""the author says that numerous factors conmtribute to Veunus reputation as a challenging planet for humans to study on"". Another reason why from the author that humans should study venus and wothy pursuit. In paragraph 3, sentence 4 ""it says that the conditions are far moire extreme than anything humans can study on encounter"". My reason why i think humans should study venus and worthy pursuit despite the danger is because in paragraph 1, sentence 1 its that in sted of calling it venus they call is Evening star and it is one of the brightest of the light in the night sky. Now in the last sentence its say that it proved a very challenging place to examine more closely. But in my own words i think it is a good idea for humans shoukld study venus because it gives you fun facts about it , How i know that is because in paragraph 8, the last sentcene its talking about you get to travle on earth and you it to see whats beyond you should not be limited by dnager or anything else. And another evidence you get to learn about new things in life and it can be a challenge for you in life also. My conclusion to this hole essay is if you can explorie anything in life then you can take a risk and in doing a challenge on exploring venus or another name for it Evening star. Not just because it can give you a fun fact it can give you a differnet experion on other people and you can show other people that there can be a differnce in everythiung that you can do.",False
"My position about this prompt is that students should not take the program that allow students to graduate them in three years, because is not like taking normal classes, for example what would happen if students get to take the program that will allow them to graduate in 3 years?

They would have to take more classes in less time:

Because as I read in the prompt there was one part that says ""for students in order to graduate must take summer courses"", and this means that they would not have a break in this time. Not because of the time but for those students that would decide that they would not only risk to fell some classes but also not to take elective classes during summer because that's what this prompt says.

It will be more stressful:

As we all know school sometimes can be stressful but imagine how stressful if for students that graduate in four years as every other normal programs that high schools offer, now imagine how it would it be for students that take programs allowing them to graduate in three years. I'll say they have to work even harder, during the summer they have to take courses in order to be upgraded to the grade the are going to, also a lot of SOL's test will be taking in less time, I'm not saying that those people won't have enough time to study, but what I'm saying is they would have a really busy schedule with all their classes plus all of those tests coming up it wont be easy for them.

The reason that why I used those examples to explain the main idea like this, it was for you to understand that such as that program it can be very difficult for students, not just that but for students that might not be quick to understand new subjects or new units, it can get them stuck in there with no option but to get into a point when they would just give it up and quit because it will get really hard for them. Now that I showed you how hard could it be for students that would take a three year high school program, now it clarifies that theres no need to rush with education and that students should take normal high school program because it wouldn't be so hard as taking the other program that I just talk about, in conclusion students have more changes to graduate with a four-year-program, as long as they keep themselves in track with what they are suppose to do it won't be no problem, and there will be less stress for them, more freedom to take a break when they need to, and enough time to study.",False
"Have you ever felt board, or idle? Thomas Jefferson ones wrote,"" Determine never to be idle... It is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing."" I strongly agree with Thomas, because when I'm feeling idle. I intend to get sad, or depressed, therefore never be idle.

Theres a lot of ways you can stay active and not be board out of your mined, for example; over the summer my Dad took me to work with him, as a carpenter. But not every one can do that, therefore here's some ideas for you: go to a gym, go for walks ,or get a job.

Going to the gym might be a big comment, but its very healthy physically and mentally, you'll start feeling good about your self, maybe even start looking good too. this is my first idea in how to stop being idle.

My second idea is walking. Walking was something that helped me fined my peace, just walking around admiring the world, breathing in the fresh air; now i'm not saying to do it alone maybe with a friend or two, or maybe walk your dog. pretty must enjoy the beautiful world that gods given us.

My third and last idea is to find a job. Working with my Dad has given me a lot of money, I bought nice shoes, cloths and bought my family things too, but it wasn't just about the money. Working with my Dad really has given me another way to look at life, gave me a reason to change my ways and made me see that the real life isn't easy. And its amazing to see the building now, to see how much its improved from last time i was there and now its just like a maze to me.

This is why I believe its never okay to be board, or idle. Because just imagine all the things you can get done, therefore, this is was i think Thomas Jefferson right when he said,"" it is wonderful how much you can get done if we are always doing.""                             ",False
"I remember when I was younger, I used to think that I could solve every problem myself. I was wrong. People always think they know best, but this is seldom true. Everyone you see walking past has faced their own set of unique challenges, and consequently each person holds a knowledge that could prove beneficial to you. Seeking advice from more than one person can help someone make a better choice, because it allows the person to consider other's experiences, perspectives, and enables them to make a less biased, more sensible decision.

Listening to the experiences of others is critical when it comes to making a good choice. Ask for advice from someone who is older and wiser. Someone with additional life experience. While it may sound cliche, your elders do have valuable lessons to share. Additionally, this life experience could include bad decisions that they, themselves, have made in the past. Learning from the mistakes of those around you is a foolproof way to avoid making a poor choice yourself. Likewise, other people may have been in a similar situation before. If another person has been faced with the same decision, or one that is related to your own, that person will, certainly, be happy to tell you what worked, or did not work, for them. Taking into account the experiences of others increases the likelihood of making a choice that leads to your success.

In addition to life experience, everyone has a different perspective. These varying point of views could allow a person to see their own situation differently. Being able to look at the issue in a new light is, undoubtedly, one of the most important factors in deciding what to do. Moreover, another person might see a solution you did not think of. Putting multiple minds together makes it far easier to solve tough challenges in life. Lastly, in a way, hearing other's perspectives provides you the ability to observe your own life in the third person. Almost as if you have exited your body and can now see what everyone else is able to see. This new vision is useful in preventing you from making a choice that you will later regret. When you consult with others, you are sure to see something you did not consider beforehand.

The experiences and perspectives of other people help you to remain impartial and sensible when it comes to decision-making. In times of stress, people have a tendency to get wrapped up and consumed in their own heads. If you have someone to calm you down, you are far more likely to not make a rash, emotional decision. Furthermore, people are often biased of their own point of view. If you do not go to multiple sources, you may end up making a choice that is unfair to others, or unfair to yourself. Lastly, seeking other people's opinions gives you opportunity to effectively weigh the pros and cons of your options. Each person has something of their own to offer, and it is crucial that you hear the voices of others when making an honest choice. All in all, listening to multiple opinions on a matter allow a person to stay logical and fair when faced with a difficult choice.

All things considered, seeking advice form multiple sources is necessary if you wish to make a well-informed decision. The experiences and point of views of those around you are crucial in staying fair and not getting clouded by your own judgment. Ultimately, those three things that you can gain from listening to what other people have to say, are what is going to stop you from doing something irrational. If you refrain from asking for advice, or only ask one person, you could be missing out on obtaining information that could keep you from doing something you will regret.",False
"Should the school board add one and a half hours to school each day?

School should not be extended any longer than it already is! Although the school board may think that school should be one hour and a half longer, students and parents believe that school hours should remain the same. I do not agree with the school board planning to add one hour and half every school day. School by its self puts a lot of pressure on the students and with a hour added its going to be much more difficult.

The school board should not add hours to school, since students are already used to the hours they get out of school. With a hour and a half students would probably get to much pressure on dealing with some school material. Students would also get much more school work. They would also get an hour taken away to spend that time with the family. It would also take time for the students to get used to leaving school an hour later! If the school hours remain the same then students would already be used to the hour schedule, and they would also have time to do after school activities!!

Because the school board wants to add an hours more of school, the school board should listen to the parents and not add another hour. It would give students much more stress. Without an hour added, it would give so much relief to alot of parents that wont have to fight for what they believe the school board should do with the time schedule.",False
"Have you ever been stuck, not knowing what choice is best? Well, seeking multiple opinions can help you make better decisions in many ways. Gaining input from your peers, parents, or teachers can help give you new ideas, stop you from doing something you'll regret, and even make you more confident in your own decisions.

Seeking for the advice and opinions of others can help you make a better choice by opening your mind to new ideas. Being open to the input of the people around you could change the way you think about a certain choice you have to make, and allow you to better weigh your options. Seeking the advice of others has definitely helped me make better decisions. One night, I was so set on going to my friend's house, but I had to watch my little sister. I kept on trying to convince my parents that she could be home alone, when really I just didn't want to have to babysit. Finally, I asked my mom if there was any way I could get around this, and she suggested having my friends over while I babysat. My dad suggested taking her with me to my friend's house. I was so focused on my idea that wasn't getting me anywhere, but when I asked for advice, new ideas were presented to me. It opened my mind to multiple options I'd never thought of before, all better than mine. This helped me make a better choice. You may be stubbornly focused, driving towards one destination in the distance, unable to see any other option. Listening the advice of the people around you can change that, giving you a whole new choice of what you could do, where you could go.

Seeking the advice of others can also help you make better decisions by stopping you from doing something you might regret. Say you're about to make a huge, life-changing decision, or even a small one. It's smart to first ask your peers, parents, or teachers if this is what's best. They may be able to stop you from doing something you will regret in the future. Your parents and teachers have experience, and hearing their input can help you make a better choice. Think about the decisions you have made in you life that you wish you had made differently. Think about how seeking the multiple opinions- from your friends, parents, people you look up to- could have helped you make a better choice. Seeking multiple opinions can show you that the decision you are making isn't the best one for you, and could help you make a choice that you won't regret later in life.

Finally, you may feel more confident in your own decisions after seeking multiple opinions. Maybe you are about to make a decision, but you are't very confident. Seeking the opinions of multiple people can help reinforce your decisions, like an extra set of armor. Last spring, my brother got into two of his top choices for grad school. Both the University of Chicago and Princeton had very good economics programs, which he had a PhD in. It was a very hard decision, so he did his research from multiple sources, including visiting both schools with family. After listening to my parents, his economics professor at his under-grad school, and seeing the schools for himself, he made the decision to go to the University of Chicago. He is finishing up his first year there now, and has loved it. Seeking multiple opinions and sources in this big decision of his life helped him make the choice that was good for him, and made him more confident in his own choice to go there.

Seeking the opinions of multiple people can help you make better choices by opening your mind up to new ideas, stopping you from doing something you might regret, and make you more confident in your own decisions.",False
"The author supports the idea that Venus is a worthy pursuit despiting all dangers by making it seem like a challenge and having interesting facts about what kind of planet it is. The author starts it off by referring to Venus as "" Earth's twin "".

In the artcle it states,""often referred to as Earth's "" twin "", Venus is the closest planet to earth in terms of density and size.""(The Challenge of Exploring Venus 2). This explains how they start to talk about Venus being interesting. Then the author starts talking abut how Venus is a difficult planet for humans to study and details about it. Sometimes, us as humans like challenges and they like to test their limit to see how far they can go. In the article it states,""Numerous factors contribute to Venus's reputation as a challenging plnet for humans to study, despite its proximity to us.""(The Challenge of Exploring Venus 2).

This explains that they see it as a challenge. Another reason that the author supports the claim is they start stating unusual facts about Venus despite the circumstances. In the text it states,""Also notable, Venus has the hottest surface temperature of any other planet in our solar system, even though Mercury is closer to our sun.""(The Challenge of Exploring Venus 3). This explains that they draw in more attention stating unusual facts. The author also talks about how professionals like astronomers find it interesting. In the text it states,""Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our system.""(The Challenge of Exploring Venus 4). This explains why people who go up into space see it as a fascinating thing.

The author makes it seem like Venus is our closest option to visit for space travel. The author tries to infrom us that studying Venus is a good thing by looking at it as meeting our curiousities and as us getting insight on what it really is. In the text it states,""Striving to meet the challenge presented by Venus has value, not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also because of human curiousity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavours.""(The Challenge of Exploring Venus 8).

"Is true that many students would like to graduate early with all the credits they need already, few students get to have that many good grades of all their school years the makes them able to graduate earlier,but of course, thats not something easy to achieve, some students maybe don't mind to taking all 4 years of high school to graduate,but others would like to take the 3 years and still get all the credits they need to graduate,even tho that may take them more work to do to achieve that.

I think it would be a good idea for students to be able to graduate with three years of high school, with the same idea that they will have to take summer courses and evenings to get all credits in three years, and the advantages of that would be that they will get out of school earlier and be able to star college, work, and a career at a earlier age, and also for students who don't like to spend too much time on school stuff, that would be like a way to get out of that faster and achieve their goals quickly, i have some friends that they graduated earlier because they had good grades, which made them have enough credits to graduate,and they doing good right now, because now they in college and achieving their goals, and i believe it would be a good idea to give other students the same opportunity, if they want to take it.",False
"To get from point A to point B, whether it be from home to the park or from school to the movies, the logical answer that pops up in everyone's mind seems to be a car. Automibles such as cars and motorcycles are widely used and are integrated into every part of society. But do automobiles really need to be so rooted into everything people do as a society? Cars and motorcycles create a myriad of problems such as congestion and smog. Some societies even legally limit their community's automobile usage to attempt to correct some essential problems. Limiting automobile usage is important, because not only is it practiced globally with tremendous success, but it also largely reduces pollution caused by diesel fuel and brings to light issues within communities and accounts for their resolution.

Automobiles are thought of as a daily commodity in most urban countries, but there are some societies in which usage has been reduced or even eliminated entirely and the positive results may be shocking. In the suburban city Vauban, Germany, residents have given up automobiles for a chance at a life free of traffic sounds and stress. This experimental journey within the town has acheived these and so much more. Their streets are essentially car-free and the lack of garages and parking space allows for up to 5,500 people to live in a single rectangular square mile with any necessary stores within walking distance (Source 1 Par 6). Simlarly-yet on a much smaller scale, Bogota, Columbia has initiated a car-free day in an attempt to eliminate the area's pollution as well as reduce stress. The day is on its third year and has done as hoped. Additionally, Bogota's once pitted and uneven sidewalks have been since replaced and made much smoother, and the city has introduced parks and sports centers, new restaruants, and new shopping centers which are blossoming and thriving (Source 4 Par 28). these changes have created a society both happy and strongly bonded. As wonderful as these positive shifts in society are, limiting autombile usage can do even more.

A limit in automible usage can also benefit communities by reducing pollution-seeing as a large majority of air pollution is created through the release of diesel fuels into the air. Paris, France legally banned personally autombile use throughout the city in order to rid the city's air of harsh pollutants (Source 2 Par 10). France experiences a combination of cold nights and warm days that trap the emmisions from cars, scooters, and motorcycles (Source 2 Par 15).  By significantly reducing the amount of diesel fuels rising to the air to be trapped, the smog had cleared enough within mere weeks that the city was able to entirely lifted the ban. This is a major example of the advantages limiting car usage entails.

Altogether, limiting automobile usage is key to improving society and has myriad advantages such as creating a more bonded and pleasant community and reduces environmental hazards like pollution. Creating vehicular limits is a promising way to change the world as we know it for the better.",False
"I write this to the Senator of Florida.

Every four years a president is elected to become what is the Commander and Chief and sole representative of the United States of America. Because we as a country are a democracy, ""the people"" get to choose the president. We go every four years, starting at the age of 18 and so on, to vote or to choose who we want to represent us as Americans. Who we want to run this country. Who we want to lead us both to success and trust that they will do all in their power to keep us safe. But are we, the people, really choosing who we want? Just like President Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Bob Dole, the U.S Chamber of Commerce, and the AFLCIO, I believe that we are not choosing at all but we are voting for a state of electors, who in turn choose a president for us.

The electoral college is very unfair to voters.""according to a gallop poll in 2000, taken shortly after Al Gore_ thanks to the quirks of the electoral college won the popular vote but lost the presidency, over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election...voters can expect another close election in which the popular vote winner could lose the presidency. The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the bestlaid defenses of the system are wrong By: Bradford Plumber If you wanted to vote for a specific president you would have to elect the state electors pledged to that president and hope they pick them. At times the electors have the right idea and other times the electors get confused and choose the wrong person. Other times the elector could even be biased or even racist in rare cases, and choose the one person that you do not see running this country.

""Because of the winnertakeall system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the ""swing"" states. During The 2000 campaign, seventeen states didnt see the candidates at all, including Rhode Island and South Carolina, and voters in 25 of the largest media markets didn't get to see a single campaign ad."" That is, because the electors are the ones that choose. The candidates don't even attempt to campaign in places they know they wont get a vote on. The candidates will try to win over the bigger states first to gain more electoral votes to win.

I see the electoral college as an unfair way for the people to vote for president. If we are truley a democracy, then we should change from using the electoral college to the use of popular vote, or direct election.",False
"Phones and Driving

Each year phones are getting more advanced, which makes them more addicting for society. This addiction has gotten so bad people use them while in the driver's seat. According to the NLM and NIH they say, ""After declining from 1999 to 2005, fatalities from distracted driving increased 28% after 2005, rising from 4572 fatalities to 5870 in 2008"". This proves the idea that distracted driving is growing because of the popularity of phones. Phones should not be allowed during driving because it puts lives at risk, it sets a bad example for future drivers, and it increases the chance for a car crash which means more cost for car damages. All drivers should pay attention to the road to ensure they are ready to respond to any situation.

All drivers should leave their phones while driving because it puts lives at risk. As stated by the Miller and Zois law firm more and more people are dying from distracted driving accidents a year. In the article it says, ""The U.S. Department of Transportation reported that cell phone use while driving kills 3-000 to 6,000 people every year."" The evidence given supports the idea that due to the use of phones being so popular the number of people in an accident increases and that many of these accidents could have been avoided if drivers had paid attention to the road. In an article made by TeenSafe, it provides an incident about a woman that killed and injured young children due to texting and driving. In the article it says, ""In May of 2017, Ohio woman Natasha Boggs, 25, killed two 14-year-old girls and severely injured a 15-year-old boy when she was texting and driving."" This was a sad accident that was caused because of the use of phones while driving. The evidence shows that the use of phones while driving causes innocent drivers to turn into killers. Phones should not be used while driving since it causes lives to be lost.

The use of phones while driving should not be allowed because it spreads to the next generation. If the older drivers text while driving it shows newer drivers that it's ok to do it. According to a survey done by Jama Pediatrics, many parents say that using phones while driving is bad but about half of them still do it. In the article, it states, ""Indeed, 52 percent of millennial parents (22 to 37 years old) and 58 percent of older parents said they thought it was 'never' safe to text and drive..... But almost two-thirds of parents have read texts while driving, and more than half of them have also written texts, the survey of 435 parents in 45 U.S. states found."" The evidence provided helps prove that parents are not providing exemplary performances for their kids who will one day grow up repeating the process. With this study done by Jama Pediatrics it stamps the idea that texting and driving should stop with the older drivers to make sure the future of driving is bright for the newer. The NHTSA has ways on lowering the rate of distracted driving crashes. As stated by the NHTSA they say, ""Parents first have to lead by example-by never driving distracted-as well as have a talk with their young driver about distraction and all of the responsibilities that come with driving. Have everyone in the family sign the pledge to commit to distraction-free driving."" This is an important comment because the next generation of drivers wouldn't now the exemplary way of driving if someone didn't show them. If parents or other qualified drivers don't teach kids the exemplary way to drive then lots of car accidents are going to happen and one of them might lose a life

Texting and driving is a dangerous activity and should not be allowed because of the increased chance of a car crash and the cost of that crash. In any car accident it can cost a lot to repair the damages and if the driver is in continuous car accidents due to texting and driving the cost can double. According to Peachtree Financial Solutions they say, ""In the event that an individual is involved in an accident with substantial damage, the typical cost can run approximately $5000 to start and then quickly increase from there, depending on the specifics of the accident."" This was included to show how much money a person could have to pay for in a car accident which could have been done by texting and driving. A study done by The Zebra on young drivers presents critical information. For example, the article says, ""Including the cost to people's lives, these crashes were responsible for $129 billion - or 15 percent - of the overall societal damage caused by motor vehicle crashes. This number only goes up after your primary offense."" The evidence shown explains that the cost of car crashes is very high. This can be best interpreted that getting into a car crash would not be beneficial to a person in a person in a car crash a situation which could be caused by texting and driving. If the cost of car crashes is constantly increasing each year then people shouldn't be texting and driving because it causes car crashes.

The evidence shown above helps prove that phones are dangerous to use while driving because it puts lives at risk, sets bad examples for future drivers, and it increases the chance of a car crash which means a lot of money to pay for damage. It's important to realize that if we don't take more offensive action to stop texting while driving then it will ruin the lives of families. If we don't stop this, the bad actions will carry on to the next generation and the next until we stop.

If we don't stop this then car crashes will continue to occur and the price for the damage will skyrocket. Texting while driving needs to be taken more seriously or the world will be chaotic.

"Most high school students prefer to do their regular four years of high school and enter college after they graduate and apply for college during their senior year to get help from their counselors and school teachers. Graduate early could be difficult for adolescents because not everyone have the same way of learning and some can be more faster than others. School districts should let the students decide whether they want to graduate early or not and give them more freedom to do want they want about their future. students that do their traditional four years do not follow this plan because it can bring pressure and anxiety, they would have to do extra work and,

they are able to pick elective classes.

Every student know that it is very important to pass their classes and be aware of how many credits they have in order to graduate. If you want to graduate early this issue can be dangerous because it can bring anxiety and pressure to adolescents during their high school years. Graduate early can make your life difficult because anxiety combine with pressure frequently gives mental problems. Some parents are constantly checking grades and that can be very frustrated towards their kids and hard to handle because they are often being told to do well and if they don't their guardians limit important items from them and usually control their life because they don't get good grades.

The fear to be behind and getting low grades are always present in students but the worries should be less for those that do not graduate early. teachers recommend to the students to take extra courses during the summer or evenings to advanced in their classes. on account of doing four years of high school you dont need to do extra work. In spite of that you still need to do your assignments at the same time but being not in a rush like the others. Every person should be responsible for their own work even if they have to do it later on it doesn't matter.

The school provides the students the opportunity to take a new subject that they haven't took before. by given them the chance to every student to choose elective courses unfortunately for those that graduate early don't have the same option because it is a waste of time receiving a class you don't need; otherwise you can take take as many as you want to challenge yourself and become better at any new topic you want to learn.

In conclusion it is a better idea if students do their traditional four years of high school. In case they need help from their teachers and schools they can get support from both. Anxiety and pressure are serious problems that any student have to pass through because it distract them from their learning and the attention of the students is also taken away. Extra time should not be used to do extra work because the kids need have to do their assignments and barely have time to do extra courses.

Everyone should have elective classes because is a good way to learn new activities in school and get distracted from your most important classes that you are taking during the school year.     ",False
"Value of Face Action Coding Systems in Schools Today,

I believe that in some cases face recogniton in classrooms could be slightly valuable but overall I think that there would be more negative effects than positive effects when it comes to Face Action Coding on school computers. Some negative effects of the Face Action Coding System could be things like innacurate face readings, more difficult or ineffective way of learning, or minimization of comunication and decreased likelyhood of relationships between students and their teachers. These examples lead me to think that facial recognition is not important for schools to have for their students.

If the face coding software was inacurate, your work would be effected in ways you might not want it to be or you could come off a different way than you are really feeling. In the text it state that the software can detect if a person beomes confused or bored with something if you make a certan facial expression. Once this happens the information would get relayed back to your teacher so he or she can make ajustments for your assignment if needed, but what if the facial expression that was made was totally erellevant to your assignment. As I do assignments I sometimes think about other things and make facial expressons about my thoughts. Maybe the expression of confusion or bordum might cross my face and get relayed back to the teacher when the facial expression made was not made because of the assignment. These are examples of how facial recognition could be giving incorrect information back to teachers.

If the computer could tell ever emotion you had towards your assignment you would never need to actually communicate face to face with your teacher. The author shows in the text that as the emotions are detected, the teacher would give modifycations to the assignment without you even asking them to or asking for help. Most communication between teachers and students is done by asking questions about assignments and how they feel about something in the class. I believe that students should be able to speak face to face to the people assigning their work instead of turning away from most communication between students and teachers.

To me I can see the Facial Coding System effecting the learning of students. In the text it states that it can modify the assignmets just like a teacher would if it detects signs of being confused or bored. If a student is neither bored or confused but the computer detects that by their facial expression, then it could change the assinment even if the student didn't need the assignment changed. This would either give the student a break by making the assignmet too easy or it would push the student out of where they need to be by making the assignment harder. This would then effect how the student learns.

In conclusion, facial recogniton in classrooms will lead to more problems than it would help by bringing it into schools. I would rather share my emothions to a teacher when I felt the need to instead of a computer telling emotions back to my teacher that may be innacurate. I also would rather have a teacher giving me modified work so It would help me in learning. This is why I disagree with Facial Coding Systems in schools today.",False
"In this passage there is a debate on a 'human faced rock formation""

whether it's a natural landform or a alien artifact. Many believed alien markings were hidden by haze. While others believed it was a natural landform based on evidence. Scientists have alot of evidence that the human face rock is just a landform. ""As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image three times bigger than the pixel size"" meaning if there was any type of alien life form on Mars then the digital images would show some type of evidence of it.

Instead, scientists just keep finding evidence and taking pictures that points everything about the human faced rock back to a natural landform.

The Face on Mars is loacted 41 degrees North martian latitiude where it was winter in April '98, a cloudy time of the year on the Red Planet. In regards to that the picture actually shows the Martain equivalent of a butte or mesa. Trying to convince someone to believe what scientists say i wold bring out alot of information about the human faced rock showing it's just a landform by telling that person scientists figured it was just a martain mesa, common around

With many saying NASA would rather hide conspiracy theories, defenders of the NASA budget wish there was an ancient civilization. Althougth few scientists believed the face was an alien artifact photographing cydonia became a priority for NASA when Mars Global Surveyor arrived on the Red planet. While eveyone was waiting for a picture of the face and it was revealed it showe no alien monument after all. Mission controllers prepared to look again ""it's not easy to target cydonia"" saif Garvin.

"Many people think that first impressions are almost impossible to change. I agree with this statement, because first impressions is something that is hard to change in your life. And when someone tries to change their first impressions they always fail. First impressions are the reasons why people don't get along because they think different about each other.

In my experience on first impressions are always bad, because when I'm going to talk to someone and the first thing I do before talking to them is judge them in good way. For example, if I'm going to a new school and I go my first day of classes, and I don't know no one in that school, and I want to talk to someone or be friends with someone, I'm going to have to talk to people in the new school, and before I talk to them I always think if they are good people or bad people. And if think that someone is bad, but in reality she/he is a really nice person. That is an example of first impressions.

I think that if you're trying to change your first impressions is going to be difficult, because you can't change something that is going to happen before you meet someone new. First impressions is something that every human has in their lives and they can't change it, because is a part of their lives.

"You may think that the Face was created by little green men who fly around in space ships, but all that is just conspiricy. As science tells us, and from what professional scientist have researched and studied at NASA, there is no life on Mars. Whether that life form be intellegent and macroscopic (visible to the naked eye) or bactireal and microscopic (only seen with a microscope). It is obvious to tell that the Face is merely an act of nature. For example, God's Thumb, a rock formation in the desert of New Mexico. The rock formation looks the way it does from centuries of erosion from wind, water, and sand. It is likely the Face has expirienced the a congruent form of events. It is also likely that the Face is a work of volcanic activity. Mars has a rich history of volcanic activiy. Mars just happens to be the home of the largest volcano in the entire solar system. From that information, it would be of no surprise to find the Face to explode in a giant fury of smoke, ash, and lava. Although, it would be an extraordinary happening to see. Going back to the previous point made erosion, apon closer inspection, you can clearly see trenches across the Face. These may very well be from liquid water flowing on the surface, wcich recent discoveries confirms. Also, around the foot of the Face, is a large gathering of rock, dust, and other debris from probabal erosion, evidence for such thing can most likely be found right in your own back yard. Say there is a small pile of dirt or a sand box your children plays in and builds a ""mountain"" as they would call it. Then after your children come inside, it rains. when the rain stops, you go out and check to see if the area is safe to play in for your children. As you inspect the area of play, you notice small trenches and wash-out around the base of the pile of sand. With all things considered, this scientific reasoning should sway your thoughts of little green men with space ships and laser blasters.",False
"people would say that teachers are the best way of showing students how to get a better understanding on subjects like math, science, etc. Every student is different because, not all students learn the same way. there is away to help every student complete and get a better understanding on every subject.

When there is a student that is getting bord or upset when a teacher is giving a lesson. The teacher cant just stop what they are doing to see what the student is upset or bord about. If schools allow students to have this kind of technology this may allow students to get a better undersatanding in the lesson. If a student is not understanding the lesson they will most likely lower there eye brows and in towards each other. This shows they dont understand what is going on. This will allow the computer to see why the student is not understanding or bord about. Than the computer will see this and modify the lesson so that the student will understand what is going on.

if a students is learning math on there computer and they are having trouble understanding what they are doing. The computer will see that they need help and it will most likely pull up a easyer way to solve the problems.

Having a school that will allow students to use this kind of technology may end up making it easyer for the student to understand there classwork or even homework. So this will allow the students to get better grades and having better understanding on the subject later on in life.",False
"Some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. That might a good idea for some students but not all. Today, many High Schoolers from the age of 15 to 18 have jobs. They work part time to help their parents pay for their phone bills, cars or something else. Sometimes they might want to work more, but school is 5 days a week, they have to do homework every night even on weekends. Going to work after school is very overwhelming. They get out at 9 or 10 depends on where they work, go home and do their homework, then go to bed probably late, and have to get up early the next morning. That goes on days after days. Many students can get stressed out easily. So I think attending classes online or video conferencing help lots of students who have jobs. Staying at home and study is still better than waking up and getting ready early in the morning to go to school. That might not be a big problem in summer or spring. But winter is the worst time of the year for students. The sun rises later than usually and sets earlier. It gets really cold and there is frozen ice on streets. Nobody wants to get up early and go to school or work when the sun hasn't even risen and frezzing weather outside. Of course they want to wrap around in their blankets and sleep in. But in the other hand, attending to school directly is better for some students. Leaning and teaching face to face is always easier than online. You could ask the teachers directly if you don't understand, and I think the teachers would be teaching and explaining in a better way face to face. Plus, you can meet new friends, socialize and participate in sports or any activities at school. So in the bottom line. I think it's better to combine both ways. The students can attend school everyday, except for snow days. They can take classes online since they can't make it to school. Cut the students some slack on some Fridays. They can stay home and attend classes online. Or only apply on seniors. Because it's their last year and they have lots of work to do. But in my opinion. Attending clases online or directly at school don't matter. What matters is that the students find their best ways to learn and relieve stress.          ",False

Smartphones, tablets, computers and other forms of digital communication are now essential tools for work, leisure and social interaction. However, with this ever-growing reliance on technology comes an associated risk - cyberbullying. Cyberbullying is defined as using electronic communication to intimidate or harass another person by sending messages that can target anyone regardless of age, gender or race. It could be through emailing abusive comments or spreading malicious rumours via text message or online chat groups such as WhatsApp and Instagram Direct Messages. Cyberbullies may also create fake social media accounts in the victim’s name in order to post embarrassing content. These techniques allow bullies to remain anonymous while causing serious emotional distress for their victims who often feel powerless against their aggressors. The effects of cyberbullying can be devastating; victims experience feelings of depression and anxiety due to the constant fear that they will be targeted by their peers again via devices which provide easy access for abusers at any time from anywhere around the world. The anonymity offered by modern devices allows people to express themselves without fear of retribution from those face-to-face conversations would normally have some level of accountability attached - making them more likely to write something hurtful or cruel about someone over the internet than if physically confronted with them face-to-face .

Honesty is a fundamental part of any healthy relationship. In the context of family and friends, being honest can aid in creating a comfortable and trusting bond. As the saying goes, honesty is the best policy. However, while honesty can be an advantage in relationships, it can also be a double-edged sword. On the one hand, speaking honestly can allow family and friends to gain a clear understanding of each other. On the other hand, it can at times lead to hurt feelings, arguments, and other consequences.

Being dishonest, or lying, can be just as damaging. Lying can lead to mistrust both in the present and in the future. It can cause feelings of guilt and anxiety, making communication difficult. Lying can be especially damaging in long-term relationships as people come to doubt the validity of what a person is saying or doing.

Honesty is the key to cultivating and maintaining strong relationships. By speaking honestly and openly, it is easier for family and friends to understand each other and to be more connected. Not only can it lead to respect in relationships, but it also fosters a greater sense of security. Plus, the longer these relationships are maintained, the stronger the sense of trust will become.",True
"Some people think the university education is to prepare students for employment. Others think it has other functions. Do you agree or disagree?

There is no one-size-fits-all answer to this question, as the function of university education may vary depending on the individual. However, some people believe that university education provides students with the necessary skills and knowledge to be successful in the workforce. Others believe that university education can be used to further one's individual interests, instead of focusing on the professional goals of the individual.

Personally, I believe that university education provides students with the necessary skills and knowledge to be successful in the workforce. I believe that this is because university education is designed to provide students with a broad base of knowledge and skills that they can use in the professional world. This allows students to develop their skills and knowledge in a variety of different areas, which is important for any individual looking to enter the workforce.

On the other hand, I do not believe that university education can be used to further one's individual interests. I believe that this is because university education is geared towards the professional goals of the individual. This is not the case with most other types of education, which is why I believe that university education is the best option for many individuals.

"Advantages of Limiting Car Usage

Limiting car usage has become a growing trend in many parts of the world, as people become more aware of the negative impact of cars on the environment. This practice is not only beneficial in addressing climate change and reducing greenhouse gas emissions, but it also has a number of other advantages. By limiting car usage, communities can promote alternative transportation options, create more compact and accessible suburbs, and improve overall quality of life.

One major advantage of limiting car usage is the promotion of alternative transportation options. When people rely less on cars, they are more likely to use public transportation, walk, bike, or carpool. The use of public transportation, such as trams and buses, reduces the number of cars on the road, resulting in less congestion and improved air quality. Additionally, walking and biking are not only environmentally friendly, but they also promote physical activity and healthier lifestyles. By limiting car usage, communities can encourage the use of these alternative transportation options and improve the overall well-being of their residents.

Another advantage of limiting car usage is the creation of more compact and accessible suburbs. Traditionally, suburbs have been built around car use, with homes spread out and connected by highways. However, this model is unsustainable and contributes to increased greenhouse gas emissions. By limiting car usage, communities can adopt a new approach to suburban planning, with homes and stores placed within walking distance of each other and public transportation easily accessible. This not only reduces reliance on cars, but it also creates a more vibrant and interconnected community.

Limiting car usage also has the potential to improve overall quality of life. Cars are a major source of stress and tension for many people. By reducing car usage, individuals can experience reduced stress levels and an improved sense of well-being. In the German suburb of Vauban, where cars are not allowed on most streets, residents have reported feeling happier and more relaxed. Furthermore, limiting car usage can also lead to quieter and safer neighborhoods, as the sound of bicycle bells and the chatter of pedestrians replace the noise of cars.

In conclusion, limiting car usage offers numerous advantages for individuals and communities. It promotes alternative transportation options, creates more compact and accessible suburbs, and improves overall quality of life. By reducing reliance on cars, we can address climate change, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and create healthier and more sustainable communities. It is important for individuals, communities, and governments to recognize the advantages of limiting car usage and work towards implementing policies and practices that encourage more sustainable forms of transportation.",True
"In recent years, the trend of minimalism has become increasingly popular. Minimalists strive to be free from consumerism and live a simpler lifestyle, focusing on experiences rather than possessions. The beauty of minimalism is that it can be applied to any aspect of life—from physical belongings to mental clutter. The concept of decluttering one’s living space has been around for centuries, but in today’s digital age, many are taking their commitment to minimalism further by ditching material goods altogether in favor of an experience-based lifestyle. One benefit of this approach is increased freedom and mobility; with fewer items tied down by ownership or responsibility, travelers have the flexibility to move quickly and explore new places more easily than ever before. For those who enjoy change and adventure but don’t want the burden (or expense) associated with material possessions such as furniture or electronics, a minimalist lifestyle can provide just that. For some people, embracing minimalism means getting rid of anything they haven’t used in the last year; for others it may mean giving away half their wardrobe or eliminating all nonessential expenses like cable TV packages or gym memberships; still others make decisions based purely on emotional attachment: if something doesn't bring them joy anymore then they no longer need it. This type of personalization makes minimalism attractive because each individual can design their own version tailored specifically for themself without having to conform strictly with anyone else's ideals. Minimalists also recognize how much time and energy we waste worrying about things we think we need when really most desires are fleeting at best– once obtained our cravings often dissipate almost immediately leaving us wondering why we wanted them in the first place! By reducing our focus on physical objects instead highlighting moments over stuff ,we learn how little material goods truly matter compared what life actually offers us—experiences filled with relationships, exploration opportunities ,and unforgettable memories .

"Advantages of Limiting Car Usage

Limiting car usage can have numerous advantages for both individuals and society as a whole. The articles “In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars” by Elisabeth Rosenthal, “Paris bans driving due to smog” by Robert Duffer, “Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota” by Andrew Selsky, and “The End of Car Culture” by Elisabeth Rosenthal provide insights into the benefits of reducing car dependency and promoting alternative modes of transportation.

One of the main advantages of limiting car usage is the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution. According to the article by Rosenthal, passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50 percent in some areas in the United States. The smog in cities like Paris, as described in Duffer’s article, is primarily caused by car emissions. By reducing car usage and promoting alternative transportation, such as walking, biking, or public transit, cities can significantly improve air quality and combat climate change.

Another advantage of limiting car usage is the improvement in quality of life for individuals. The article on the German suburb of Vauban highlights how residents who have given up their cars feel a sense of relief and happiness. They no longer experience the stress associated with car ownership and the constant need to navigate through traffic. Instead, they enjoy walking on verdant streets and hearing the swish of bicycles. This is echoed in Selsky’s article on Bogota, where residents experience a car-free day, leaving the streets devoid of traffic jams. This allows people to move around the city easily and enjoy a stress-free commute.

Additionally, limiting car usage can lead to more compact and accessible communities. Rosenthal’s article on the end of car culture in the United States discusses how people are buying fewer cars and driving less, indicating a shift in behavior and preferences. This shift paves the way for smart planning and the development of communities that are less dependent on cars. As Selsky’s article on Bogota shows, car-free days have resulted in the construction of bicycle paths and the transformation of sidewalks, making the city more pedestrian-friendly. This creates a more inclusive and sustainable community where people can easily access amenities and reduce their reliance on private vehicles.

Furthermore, limiting car usage can have economic benefits. Duffer’s article on the Paris driving ban highlights how congestion in the city was reduced by 60 percent during the smog crisis. This not only improves air quality but also increases the efficiency of transportation in the city. Less time spent in traffic means more productivity and reduced economic losses. The implementation of car-reduced communities, as mentioned in Rosenthal’s article, can also lead to financial savings for individuals who no longer need to own a car, as they have access to alternative means of transportation.

In conclusion, limiting car usage has numerous advantages, including the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution, improved quality of life for individuals, the development of compact and accessible communities, and economic benefits. By promoting alternative modes of transportation, such as walking, biking, and public transit, cities can create a more sustainable and inclusive environment for their citizens. It is crucial for individuals and communities to embrace this shift in behavior and work towards a future with reduced car dependency.",True

    More and more businesses are beginning to embrace the idea of a four-day workweek. By reducing the number of days worked each week to four, employees have more days off, leading to lower stress levels, increased motivation and fresh energy for the days worked. This can also have a significant impact on the environment and can help cut down on energy and resource consumption.

If applied to the education system, adopting a four-day school week model can likewise bring advantages to students, their families, and the environment. For example, students can have more flexibility in their schedules, allowing them to spend additional time on outside activities, such as music lessons, sports, hobby clubs, and community work. They can also use their three-day weekend to rest and recharge for the next week, reducing their stress levels and anxiety about homework and tests. Furthermore, the four-day school week model helps reduce energy and resource consumption. By closing the school for one day each week, energy costs go down, as well as the amount of paper, resources, and waste produced.

Families can also benefit from a four-day school week model, by having more days of freedom to get out and explore. They can save money on transportation to and from school and on extracurricular activities, as well as less food waste produced from lunches. Additionally, they will have more time to connect more often as a family.

By adopting a four-day school week model, students, their families, and the environment can yield benefits. It will help create a healthier, more successful environment for those involved while helping reduce stress, energy consumption, and resource waste.",True

"Organ donation is a selfless act of generosity that can save and improve the lives of many people in need. Every year, thousands of individuals are in desperate need of organ transplants to survive dire health conditions, yet there is an extreme shortage due to inadequate donor registration numbers. It is up to us as citizens and responsible members of society to recognize the importance donating organs has for those who are suffering from life-threatening illnesses – and actively commit ourselves to becoming registered donors if we are medically eligible. Organ donations can have a powerful impact on the quality of life for recipients and their families. In particular, heart transplants offer recipients an opportunity at improved health while they wait years on end for other treatments or procedures with little success. When someone signs up as a donor they increase their chances dramatically, creating hope where it was once all but lost; this gift transcends even death itself by offering another person’s time and energy spent living amongst them after their own passing. Registering yourself as an organ donor requires minimal effort, but will provide immense benefit for those who receive your organs should you pass away unexpectedly or become too ill to make decisions about your medical care yourself. The process involves filling out some paperwork when applying for or renewing your driver’s license/ID card at any local DMV office in accordance with state regulations (please note that if you live outside United States permanent residence status may still be accepted). Upon completion you will then become officially listed on your state's registry database which ensures organs donated will be distributed fairly across the nation without favoritism based on race/ethnicity socioeconomic class etc., thereby meeting ethical standards set forth under American Transplant Association guidelines. Making such a generous decision carries no greater reward than knowing that what you do today could potentially give someone else tomorrow – so please consider registering yourself as an organ donor today!

Dear Senator [Senator's Last Name],

I am writing to express my perspective on the topic of the Electoral College and to argue in favor of keeping this system for the election of the President of the United States.

As the Office of the Federal Register describes, the Electoral College was established by the founding fathers as a compromise between electing the President by Congress and by popular vote. The system includes the selection of electors, the electoral vote by those electors, and the counting of electoral votes by Congress (Passage 1). This process ensures a balanced representation of each state, as the number of electors is determined by the total members of Congress from each state (Passage 3). This contributes to the protection of smaller states against potential dominance by larger states, as it prevents candidates from focusing solely on densely populated regions and encourages the consideration of all citizens' interests.

One key benefit of the Electoral College is the certainty of outcome it provides. As Judge Richard A. Posner explains, the winner of the Electoral College inevitably obtains a majority of electoral votes, even if their share of the popular vote is slight (Passage 18). This reduces the likelihood of disputes over the election results and ensures a clear winner. On the other hand, if the popular vote alone determined the outcome, disputes could arise more frequently, leading to prolonged legal battles and uncertain results.

The Electoral College also promotes a sense of unity and representation for all citizens. Posner states that the system requires presidential candidates to have trans-regional appeal, as no single region has enough electoral votes to secure a presidency (Passage 19). This encourages candidates to campaign in various states and address the concerns of diverse regions, promoting a balanced representation of all citizens' interests. In contrast, a popular vote system may lead to candidates solely focusing on densely populated areas and neglecting the concerns of citizens in less populous regions.

Moreover, the Electoral College encourages candidates to pay attention to swing states, which are crucial in deciding the election outcome (Passage 20). These states are more likely to receive more campaign efforts, resulting in better-informed voters who actively participate in the election process. This ensures that the most thoughtful voters have a deciding role in electing the President.

Lastly, the Electoral College balances the political influence of large and small states. Posner highlights that the popular vote in a large state, such as Florida, carries more weight in the Electoral College system compared to a small state like Wyoming (Passage 21). This prevents large states from dominating the election process and ensures that candidates pay attention to the concerns of citizens in both large and small states.

While some argue that the Electoral College could discourage voters in non-competitive states, it is worth noting that voter turnout in presidential elections remains high, indicating that individuals still have the motivation to express their political preferences (Passage 23).

In conclusion, the Electoral College is a vital component of our democratic system that ensures fair representation for all citizens and provides certainty in election outcomes. It encourages candidates to campaign across all states, avoids disputes over results, and balances the influence of large and small states. For these reasons, I strongly believe that the Electoral College should be maintained for the election of the President of the United States.

Thank you for considering my perspective on this matter.

"Moderation in all things is a phrase that has been around for a very long time and is often used to give advice and impose limits on behavior. Despite it's popularity, this phrase is not entirely sound advice, as it implies that moderation is the best approach in all situations. Instead, one should consider the situation and decide if moderation, or even intense focus, is best.

The phrase “Moderation in all things” is too simplistic and can be misleading. Too often, people take this phrase to mean that they should always show restraint and never take risks. Many times, however, taking risks and pushing oneself to the limit is necessary in order to achieve success. For example, athletes strive to win and will often push themselves to their physical limits in order to do so. This could be true for a marathon runner who puts in long hours of training or for a weightlifter who is pushing themselves to lift heavier weights. Both individuals have to take risks in order to achieve their goals. Similarly, businesses must often take risks in order to succeed. Entrepreneurs have to take risks in marketing and other areas in order to try and make their business ideas successful. Without taking risks, it is difficult to make progress in any area.

In addition, there are certain activities that actually require intense focus rather than moderation. For example, an artist or musician must give their project their full attention in order to create something that is of high quality. A painter must put in hours of work and really focus on the details in order to create a painting that is well done. The same is true for a musician who needs to practice their instrument and focus on the finer points of their craft in order to create a piece of music that is good. Similarly, scientists and researchers must put in hours of work to make progress and sometimes have to push themselves to the limit in order to make a breakthrough.

In conclusion, it is clear that moderation in all things is not the best advice. In some cases, taking risks and pushing oneself to the limit is necessary in order to succeed. In addition, certain activities require intense focus rather than moderation in order to be successful. Therefore, it is better to consider the situation and decide if moderation, or even intense focus, is best.

"As a grade 10 student, I believe that limiting car usage is essential for the betterment of our community and the environment. The advantages of reducing car usage are numerous, and I will outline some of the most significant benefits in this essay.

Firstly, limiting car usage can help reduce air pollution. According to the World Health Organization, air pollution is a major environmental risk to health, causing an estimated 7 million premature deaths each year. Cars are a significant contributor to air pollution, emitting harmful gases such as carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, and particulate matter. By reducing the number of cars on the road, we can significantly decrease the amount of air pollution in our community.

Secondly, limiting car usage can help reduce traffic congestion. We all know how frustrating it can be to sit in traffic, wasting time and fuel. According to the Texas A&M Transportation Institute, the average person spends around 42 hours per year stuck in traffic. By reducing the number of cars on the road, we can reduce traffic congestion and make our commutes faster and more efficient.

Thirdly, limiting car usage can promote physical activity. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, regular physical activity can help reduce the risk of chronic diseases such as heart disease, diabetes, and some types of cancer. By walking, biking, or taking public transportation instead of driving, we can incorporate physical activity into our daily routines and improve our overall health.

Another advantage of limiting car usage is that it can help reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Cars are a significant contributor to greenhouse gas emissions, which are a major contributor to climate change. According to the Union of Concerned Scientists, transportation is responsible for approximately 27% of greenhouse gas emissions in the United States. By reducing the number of cars on the road, we can significantly decrease the amount of greenhouse gas emissions and help combat climate change.

Lastly, limiting car usage can save us money. According to the American Automobile Association, the average cost of owning and maintaining a car is approximately $8,500 per year. By reducing the number of cars in our households, we can save money on fuel, maintenance, and other expenses.

In conclusion, limiting car usage has numerous advantages, including reducing air pollution, traffic congestion, promoting physical activity, reducing greenhouse gas emissions, and saving us money. As a grade 10 student, I believe that it is our responsibility to take action and reduce our reliance on cars. We can do this by choosing alternative modes of transportation such as walking, biking, or taking public transportation, carpooling, or using electric or hybrid vehicles. Together, we can make a positive impact on our community and the environment.",True
"There is no question that the number of cars in use will decline in the next twenty years. The combination of ride-sharing services, self-driving cars, and increased public transportation options will make car ownership less necessary.

Ride-sharing services like Uber and Lyft have exploded in popularity in recent years. These services allow people to share rides with others who are going in the same direction. This eliminates the need for a personal car, since the rider can use the ride-sharing service to get to and from their destination.

Self-driving cars are also expected to play a large role in reducing the number of cars in use. These cars are able to drive themselves, which means that people will no longer need to own a car in order to get around. In addition, self-driving cars are expected to be much more efficient than traditional cars, which will help to reduce traffic congestion.

Public transportation is also becoming increasingly popular. Cities are investing in new, high-quality public transportation options, such as light rail and bus rapid transit. These options are cheaper and more efficient than cars, and they also help to reduce traffic congestion.

All of these factors point to a future in which there are fewer cars in use than there are today. This will be a positive development, since it will reduce traffic congestion, save people money, and reduce our reliance on fossil fuels.

"In recent years, there has been increasing attention paid to the importance of self-care; a concept that advocates taking necessary steps to prioritize one's physical and mental health. With more people turning away from traditional medical options and towards alternative forms of treatment, such as acupuncture or homeopathic remedies, understanding how to foster a healthy lifestyle is key. One way to do this is through the practice of yoga. Yoga is an ancient form of exercise which can be incredibly beneficial for both body and mind alike if done properly. Physically, it increases flexibility by loosening tight muscles and strengthening weak ones; mentally it promotes clarity by emphasizing deep breathing techniques which allow practitioners to enter into a meditative state free from anxiety or stressors in daily life; emotionally it encourages acceptance by focusing on being present rather than ruminating on past events or worrying about what lies ahead in the future. Furthermore, unlike many other activities available today—such as running or crossfit—yoga poses are adaptable so they can accommodate any level of skill without straining the body beyond its limits. The main benefit of practicing yoga regularly is improved overall health: regular stretching helps keep joints limber while deep breathing exercises help regulate blood pressure and reduce stress levels over time. Additionally, because yogic postures typically involve holding certain positions for several minutes at a time before moving onto another pose—it acts as an excellent form of low-impact cardio exercise too: not only does this type of activity burn calories quickly but also strengthens your core muscles simultaneously! Finally, because each posture requires full concentration (both physically & mentally), it acts as an effective distraction technique when dealing with difficult emotions such as anger or frustration - allowing practitioners ""to process their feelings without judgment"". Practicing yoga allows individuals to gain control over their own wellness without relying solely on external sources like doctors or medications - something that’s becoming increasingly important given today’s busy lifestyles & hectic schedules!

"Limiting car usage has a multitude of advantages that can greatly benefit our communities and the environment. As seen in the passages, there are several successful examples of car-free communities and initiatives that have proven to be effective in reducing greenhouse gas emissions and improving the quality of life for residents.

One advantage of limiting car usage is the significant reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. According to the passages, passenger cars are responsible for a substantial percentage of emissions in both Europe and the United States. By reducing car usage, we can contribute to the global effort to combat climate change. In the German suburb of Vauban, where car ownership is limited and alternative modes of transportation are encouraged, 70% of families do not own cars. This demonstrates that it is possible to live without cars and still have a functional and vibrant community.

In addition to reducing emissions, limiting car usage can also improve air quality and reduce pollution. The passage about Paris banning driving due to smog illustrates the negative impact of excessive car usage on the environment. The city experienced near-record pollution levels, which prompted the enforcement of a partial driving ban. As a result, congestion decreased by 60% and the quality of air improved. This example shows that by reducing car usage, we can mitigate air pollution and create healthier living environments.

Another advantage of limiting car usage is the promotion of alternative and sustainable modes of transportation. By restricting car usage, communities like Bogota in Colombia have seen a rise in alternative transportation methods such as biking, walking, and public transit. Bogota's car-free day has become a successful event that encourages residents to find alternative ways of commuting. This not only reduces traffic congestion but also promotes physical activity and healthier lifestyles.

Furthermore, limiting car usage can lead to more compact and accessible communities. The German suburb of Vauban is an example of a community that has adopted smart planning principles by placing stores within walking distance and minimizing the need for extensive parking spaces. This approach not only makes it more convenient for residents to access essential services but also fosters a sense of community and reduces dependence on cars.

In conclusion, limiting car usage has numerous advantages that can improve our environment, reduce emissions, and enhance the quality of life in our communities. The passages provide evidence of successful car-free communities and initiatives that have shown positive results in terms of reduced emissions, improved air quality, and increased use of alternative transportation. By embracing these examples and implementing similar strategies, we can move towards a future where limited car usage becomes the norm, benefiting both individuals and the planet.",True
"People often overlook the profound impact that art can have on our lives. Art has been around for centuries, and it is a crucial part of many cultures around the world. While some people may think of art as merely a form of entertainment or an expression of creativity, its effects are much more pervasive and long-lasting than most would expect. In this essay, I will discuss how art has had a positive effect on my life and why it should be appreciated by everyone. Art allows us to express ourselves in ways that words cannot convey. It provides us with an outlet through which we can release our emotions in order to make sense of them. This aspect of art has been particularly significant for me since I was young; painting was something I could do when I needed time away from stress or anxiety so that I could better process my feelings without judgement or criticism from others. Visual artwork gave me an opportunity to explore parts of myself that felt difficult to communicate with words alone. By creating pieces reflective of my inner self, I was able to come closer towards understanding who I am at my core—something no other medium could offer me in such a tangible fashion. Moreover, immersing myself within different artistic practices exposed me to new ideas and perspectives that encouraged critical thinking about important issues like social justice or environmentalism which were not discussed enough during school hours in the curriculum set forth by educators nor any other media sources available at the time . Through observing artwork created by members outside my immediate community, especially those coming from lower income backgrounds or marginalized identities ,I gained insight into complex topics often ignored by mainstream education systems yet still highly relevant today .

"I agree that the most essential quality of an effective leader is the ability to remain consistently committed to particular principles and objectives. Leadership is about providing guidance and direction to others, and a leader can do this most effectively when they remain focused on their ideas and ideals in the face of any opposition. Sticking to a particular set of principles and objectives allows a leader to remain unshaken, even when the public’s opinion shifts.

One example of a leader who exemplified this quality is Mahatma Gandhi. Gandhi was a passionate advocate of non-violent protest, and he dedicated his life to promoting a non-violent resistance to British rule. While other leaders of the Indian independence movement were more eager to embrace armed struggle, Gandhi remained committed to non-violence as his path to achieving independence. His dedication to this principle, despite the immense public pressure to take a more militant approach, was an essential element of his success.

Another example is Nelson Mandela, who led the fight against apartheid in South Africa. Faced with a regime that was oppressive and violent in it's enforcement of racial segregation, Mandela understood that the only way to end apartheid was through peaceful resistance. By remaining committed to this principle, despite the immense public pressure to respond to violence with violence, Mandela was able to bring about meaningful change and help free his people from oppressive rule.

Remaining committed to particular principles and objectives is essential to any effective leader. A leader who can remain firm in the face of public opinion is better able to guide and direct those they are leading. When a leader wavers or changes their objectives in response to popular opinion, they risk losing the trust of their followers, as well as their own authority. This can lead to a lack of confidence in the leader and their ideas, which can make it difficult for them to accomplish their objectives.

In conclusion, the most essential quality of an effective leader is the ability to remain consistently committed to particular principles and objectives. Leaders like Mahatma Gandhi and Nelson Mandela were able to achieve success because they had the strength to resist public opinion and remain committed to their ideals. Any leader who wavers in the face of shifting public opinion will be unable to achieve their goals.

Completing high school in three instead of four years is certainly a tempting idea, as it shortens the amount of time that students spend in school if they wish to enter college or the professional workforce early. However, there are some potential drawbacks to consider, including stress and a lack of elective classes. 

On the positive side, finishing high school early allows students to save time and energy during a crucial period in their developmental years, allowing them to focus more directly on other pursuits. In addition, leaving high school early can give students an advantage for college acceptance, scholarships, and internships. Furthermore, those who enter the workforce at an earlier age may have more opportunities for professional development and career advancement, as they have a longer period of time to build their experiences and skills. 

However, finishing high school early can also lead to stress. Students who are in a hurry to finish their courses may not give themselves time to fully digest the material, which can put them at a disadvantage when moving on to the next stage. In addition, students may miss out on certain elective classes if they cannot find enough time in their course load. Many students rely on elective courses to gain knowledge in areas they are passionate about, so this can be a problem if there isn’t sufficient time. 

In conclusion, it is an individual choice whether or not to finish high school early. While there are some potential advantages, such as taking advantage of college or career opportunities, there are also possible drawbacks, such as increased stress and lack of elective courses.

It is often said that first impressions are everything, and they can have a powerful influence on how we view another person. But is it always the case that first impressions are accurate? The truth is, first impressions can change after we get to know a person. This has been supported both by personal experiences and factual evidence.

On a personal level, I have found that sometimes my first impressions of someone have proven to be inaccurate after getting to know them better. A few years ago, I met someone who immediately rubbed me the wrong way. On the surface, they seemed cocky and rude. But as I got to know them better, this person eventually became one of my closest friends. It turns out, they were actually quite humble and kind, and I was glad that I decided to give them a chance despite my first impressions.

This idea has also been supported by academic research. In a 2012 study, researchers asked participants to watch brief videos of strangers and form an impression. The study found that the more information participants had about the persons in the video, the more their first impression changed. These findings suggest that the more interaction we have with someone, the more our initial impression of them may change.

Overall, it appears that first impressions are not always an accurate indicator of someone's personality or character. This is why it is important to look beyond the surface of any person and get to know them better. All too often, a knee-jerk reaction to a first impression can lead to judgments that are not entirely valid and might be better described as an educated guess.",True
"There are two schools of thought when it comes to teaching children how to interact with others. Some people believe that children should learn to compete, while others think that children should be taught to cooperate. I believe that children should be taught to cooperate with others.

One reason why I believe this is because competition can often lead to negative feelings such as envy, resentment, and bitterness. These negative emotions can damage relationships and make it difficult to work together. Cooperation, on the other hand, fosters positive feelings such as trust, respect, and teamwork. These positive emotions make it easier to work together and build strong relationships.

Another reason why I believe children should be taught to cooperate is because cooperation leads to more successful outcomes. When people work together, they can pool their resources and knowledge to achieve a common goal. This is often more effective than having each person working independently.

There are a few exceptions to this rule. For example, competition can be helpful in situations where people need to be motivated to achieve a goal. However, in most cases, cooperation is the better option.

For instance, they may use their professional skills to help people in need, such as offering free tutoring to students, or providing legal advice to those who can’t afford it. Others may use their skills to help the environment, such as by planting trees or helping to clean up rivers.

Moreover, many young people are involved in volunteering with different organisations, such as non-profit organisations or charities. They are able to use the skills they’ve gained from their education and work to help those in need. For instance, they may use their knowledge of graphic design or web development to help create campaigns or websites for charity organisations. Additionally, they can help out at local events, such as festivals and community gatherings, where they can assist with organising activities and distributing information.

In conclusion, young people are devoting time to helping their communities in different ways.

"In Support of the Electoral College

Dear [State Senator's Name],

I hope this letter finds you well. I am writing to express my support for the Electoral College and to share my reasons for opposing a change to a popular vote system for the election of the President of the United States.

The Electoral College, as established by the founding fathers, serves as a compromise between the election of the President by Congress and a direct popular vote. It consists of a process where electors are chosen based on the number of members in their state's Congressional delegation, including Representatives and Senators. Each candidate running for President has their own group of electors, who are generally chosen by their political party.

One of the key advantages of the Electoral College is the certainty of outcome. Unlike a direct popular vote, the Electoral College system ensures a clear winner, as the winning candidate's share of the electoral vote invariably exceeds their share of the popular vote. This reduces the likelihood of disputes over the election outcome, as seen in the 2000 election. Additionally, the winner-take-all method of awarding electoral votes creates a landslide electoral-vote victory in each state, incentivizing candidates to campaign nationwide and appeal to a diverse range of voters.

Furthermore, the Electoral College promotes the idea of a unifying President who represents all regions of the country. As no single region has enough electoral votes to elect a President, candidates need to have trans-regional appeal. This ensures that the President takes into account the interests of all regions, preventing the feeling of disenfranchisement among residents in regions that may not be strongholds for a particular candidate.

The Electoral College also gives significance to swing states, allowing for a more focused and meaningful campaign. Candidates are encouraged to concentrate their efforts on states where the election outcome is uncertain, ensuring that voters in these states receive more attention and information about the candidates' policies and plans. This fosters engagement and informed decision-making among voters in swing states.

Additionally, the Electoral College provides balance between small and large states. While the mal-apportionment of the Senate can lead to a disparity in representation, the Electoral College guarantees that all states have a voice and influence in the presidential election process. Large states receive more attention from candidates due to their higher number of electoral votes, ensuring that their concerns and priorities are not overlooked.

Lastly, the Electoral College avoids the need for run-off elections when no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast. This saves time, resources, and potential complications in the election process. History has shown that the Electoral College consistently produces a clear winner, even in cases where a candidate has only achieved a plurality of the popular vote.

In conclusion, the Electoral College system provides several benefits and serves as a vital component of our democracy. It ensures a clear and certain outcome, promotes a unifying President who represents all regions, encourages meaningful campaigning in swing states, provides balance between small and large states, and avoids the need for run-off elections. For these reasons, I urge you to consider the advantages of the Electoral College and advocate for its preservation.

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I trust that you will consider my perspective as you deliberate on this important issue. Please do not hesitate to reach out to me if you have any questions or require further information.

"The impact the Covid-19 pandemic has had on small businesses is far reaching and devastating. Small business owners have endured economic losses, increased stress levels and declining morale during this difficult time. This essay will explore how the pandemic has affected profitability, employee wellbeing and customer service for small businesses in the United States. Profitability is a critical concern for any business owner but particularly for those with limited resources like small businesses. With stay-at-home orders in place across much of the country, many small enterprises have seen their profits take a huge hit due to lockdowns, reduced foot traffic or even complete closure of their establishments. Even when reopenings occur it may prove difficult to make up lost revenue as customers remain cautious about spending money in physical stores or restaurants out of fear of catching the virus. Without government assistance or other sources of financial aid these companies are likely to suffer long term effects that could prevent them from achieving pre-pandemic success levels again anytime soon. Taking care of employees’ mental health and wellbeing is also an important consideration during such trying times since it can affect productivity and job satisfaction among workers significantly if not addressed properly by employers. Worrying about their safety while performing essential duties such as serving food, ringing up purchases or cleaning rooms makes work more stressful than usual even under normal circumstances; now add the threat posed by Covid-19 into mix and one can only imagine what kind of burden some staff members might be dealing with each day which could ultimately lead to burn out at worst case scenario if not managed timely enough before its too late . Therefore , being flexible with scheduling whenever possible , providing additional benefits like access to online counseling sessions plus proper training on sanitary procedures are all ways that employers can help ease anxiety among workers who feel threatened by risk associated with returning back to work . . Lastly , changes made in customer service policies related to hygiene standards must be taken into account including implementation social distancing measures inside

"Baseball is a beloved game for many Americans, as well its players and fans around the world. From Little League to the Major Leagues, millions of people have been devotees of this unique pastime over multiple generations. However, at no time has baseball been more popular than in the late nineteenth century when America’s first professional teams began to form and compete. The very first professional team was organized in 1869 by Harry Wright, an English-born former cricket player who organized his Cincinnati Red Stockings into a solid unit that toured the Midwest and East Coast playing other clubs composed mainly of ex-amateurs—hence their name “professional” teams. A few years later more franchises were established: The Boston Red Stockings (now known as Braves), Chicago White Stockings (now Cubs), Philadelphia Athletics (Philadelphia Phillies) and New York Mutuals (the Mets). This new league, called the National Association of Professional Base Ball Players (NAPBBP), marked the beginning of modern baseball with rules outlined for bat design and field measurements, regular season length structures that encouraged competition among teams during each sport season's championship play offs; all culminating with the introduction of a World Series format in 1903 which still exists today!. The popularity surge from these early days continued throughout subsequent decades while attendance records set by average everyday citizens kept growing year after year. It wasn't until television broadcasting became available in 1947 that viewership numbers experienced even greater jumps due to availability outside stadiums themselves or radio broadcasts within them; making it easier for everyone to follow along on any given day just about anywhere imaginable! With superstars like Babe Ruth, Willie Mays or Jackie Robinson dominating headlines every summer - regardless whether they struck out three times or smashed homeruns – even non-baseball fans could be seen wearing replica jerseys proudly supporting one side or another while proclaiming allegiance over social media outlets with simple hashtags such #GoCubsGo!.

"There is no question that young people enjoy life more than older people do. Numerous studies have shown that young people are generally more optimistic, energetic, and content with their lives than older people are.

One reason for this is that young people are not as burdened by the responsibilities and obligations of adulthood. They are free to explore their interests and passions without worrying about the consequences. As a result, they are more likely to have a positive outlook on life and enjoy the moment.

Another reason is that young people are generally more optimistic. They have not experienced as much pain and hardship in their lives, which allows them to approach life with a positive attitude. They are also less likely to be burdened by negative thoughts and feelings. As a result, they are more likely to be content with their lives.

Finally, young people are generally more energetic. They are not as burdened by the stresses of everyday life and are more likely to enjoy the simple pleasures in life. This energy is often infectious and can lead to a positive attitude in others.

All of these factors contribute to the fact that young people enjoy life more than older people do. There is no doubt that this is a positive trend that will continue into the future.

"When it comes to the miracle of childbirth, few topics are as awe-inspiring and humbling as that of midwifery. Midwives have long been involved in helping women bring their babies into the world since ancient times, and even today they remain integral members of many birthing teams around the world. The practice of midwifery has evolved considerably over time, yet one thing remains constant: its emphasis on providing a safe, supportive environment for mothers throughout pregnancy, labor and birth. At its core, midwifery is all about giving care with respect; recognizing that each woman's experience is unique and honoring her personal choices regarding labor and delivery. Midwives provide both physical support throughout a woman's journey to motherhood - such as providing information on nutrition or checking vital signs - but also emotional assistance by offering comfort measures during labor like massage or simply being present for moral support when needed most. This holistic approach helps create an atmosphere where mothers feel empowered to make informed decisions about their body in order to give them –and their babies–the best chance at having an enjoyable birthing process. What sets midwives apart from other healthcare providers is often cited as the ability for them to form meaningful relationships with expecting mothers based on mutual trust which allows greater autonomy over decision making without sacrificing safety protocols. Furthermore this bond can lead to improved postpartum outcomes because feelings of security can help reduce stress levels which are known contributing factors towards issues such as postnatal depression. Studies suggest that those who receive continuous care from a midwife during pregnancy tend to rate higher satisfaction scores than those whose care was fragmented between different health practitioners (for instance switching between obstetricians). By embracing evidence-based practices while also recognizing humanistic values such as empathy and compassion, today’s generations of midwives continue expanding our collective understanding of how best we can assist expectant parents before, during and after childbirth so that every family may enjoy an optimal experience

"The renaissance of community gardens in urban areas has become an important trend for many cities and towns across the United States. Community gardening is a way to promote healthy eating habits, foster local economic development, and encourage social interaction within neighborhoods. In recent years, this activity has seen a resurgence of interest among city dwellers looking to create green spaces in their communities while also being involved in something that benefits them personally. Community gardens provide many different opportunities for residents of all ages and backgrounds to get involved with their neighbors. Not only do they offer the chance to grow organic fruits, vegetables, herbs and flowers locally; but they also allow individuals or families the opportunity to share resources such as tools or composting material with each other. Furthermore, these gardens can be utilized as gathering places where people from diverse ethnic groups come together under one common goal: cultivating a shared space filled with goodwill. By providing access to fresh ingredients harvested from home-grown sources, these plots help locals save money on groceries while making it easier for everyone in the area to have access to nutritious food options regardless of income level. Additionally, since most community garden projects are initiated by local volunteers who often live near these sites themselves; there is an increased sense of ownership amongst participants which brings about an even greater commitment towards achieving success collectively than could ever be accomplished individually at home. Another advantage provided by community gardening activities lies within its potential use as part of urban planning initiatives; particularly those geared towards revitalizing low-income neighborhoods or increasing employment opportunities through self-employment training programs centered around farming skills taught in schools or offered through apprenticeships at established farms nearby. Local businesses might show more willingness investing into certain areas if they see that residents are putting time and effort into improving their surroundings already – thereby creating a better environment for both business owners AND citizens alike!

"Advantages of Limiting Car Usage

Limiting car usage has numerous advantages for individuals, communities, and the environment. By implementing strategies to reduce dependence on cars, such as car-free zones and promoting alternative modes of transportation, we can create safer, healthier, and more sustainable communities.

One of the primary benefits of limiting car usage is the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. According to research cited in the passage set, passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States. By decreasing reliance on cars, we can significantly reduce these emissions and mitigate the negative effects of climate change.

Additionally, limiting car usage can improve air quality. The passage about Paris implementing a partial driving ban to clear the air of pollution highlights how car emissions contribute to smog and poor air quality in cities. By promoting alternative modes of transportation such as walking, biking, and public transit, we can reduce air pollution and create healthier environments for citizens.

Limiting car usage also has positive effects on public health. As mentioned in the passage about Vauban, Germany, residents who have given up their cars report feeling happier and less stressed. This is because relying on cars can often lead to traffic congestion, long commutes, and increased stress levels. By creating car-free zones and promoting alternative transportation options, we can reduce traffic congestion and improve the overall well-being of citizens.

Furthermore, limiting car usage can foster more connected and vibrant communities. The passage about Bogota, Colombia, describes how millions of residents hiked, biked, or took buses to work during a car-free day, resulting in streets devoid of traffic jams. This not only promotes alternative transportation but also creates opportunities for people to interact with each other, leading to stronger social connections and a sense of community.

Lastly, limiting car usage can lead to economic benefits. The passage about the United States decreasing car ownership and driving miles suggests that it may have a long-term cultural shift with implications for the car industry. While this shift may have negative effects on car manufacturers, it can result in positive economic changes in other areas. For example, as more people rely on alternative modes of transportation, there may be increased demand for public transit systems, bike-sharing programs, and other related industries.

In conclusion, limiting car usage offers numerous advantages for individuals, communities, and the environment. By reducing greenhouse gas emissions, improving air quality, promoting public health, fostering connected communities, and potentially bringing economic benefits, we can create a more sustainable and livable future. It is essential that we prioritize implementing strategies to limit car usage and promote alternative transportation options for the benefit of all.",True

"I agree with those who think that children should be taught to cooperate. Cooperation is key to success in life, and it is important for children to learn how to work together as a team. When children are taught to cooperate, they are more likely to be successful in their careers and relationships.

One example of how cooperation can lead to success is when a group of children are working on a project. If each child is working independently, they may not be able to complete the project on time. However, if the children work together, they can complete the project much more quickly. This is because they are able to communicate with each other and work together as a team.

Another reason why children should be taught to cooperate is because it can be a lot of fun. When children cooperate, they are able to create a fun environment. This is important because it can help children to learn. When children are having fun, they are more likely to pay attention in class and learn the information that is being taught.

"I disagree with the statement that it is inappropriate to fund the arts with public resources when people in a society are hungry, out of work, or lack basic skills needed to survive. In fact, I believe that allocating funding to the arts can be beneficial in addressing these issues.

The arts have the potential to serve as a powerful force for good, particularly when it comes to providing support, inspiration, and opportunities to those in need. For example, art programs can provide an outlet to those who are struggling with unemployment, poverty, or limited access to education. By offering creative activities, such as painting, drawing, theater, and dance, individuals can channel their energies into positive outlets, find an emotional release from their circumstances, and gain valuable skills. Additionally, through art programs, individuals can develop and further their social and networking skills, helping them to become more employable.

At the same time, public funding for the arts can help support local arts organizations and businesses, as well as create job opportunities for artists and related professionals. This in turn can help to strengthen the local economy and provide more economic opportunities for those who are in need. Furthermore, it can help to attract more tourists and other visitors to the area, which can lead to increased economic activity and benefits for the local community.

Finally, investing in the arts can have a positive impact on the mental health and well-being of individuals. Artistic activities have been shown to have a calming effect on people, and can help to reduce stress and anxiety levels. Additionally, engaging in the arts can help to boost self-esteem and confidence, and can provide individuals with a sense of purpose and accomplishment.

In conclusion, I believe that public funding for the arts can be beneficial in supporting those in need, and I disagree with the statement that it is inappropriate to provide such funds when people in a society are suffering from hunger, unemployment, or lack of basic skills.

"There are many different ways to travel, each with it's own advantages and disadvantages. Some people prefer to travel alone, while others find that group travel is more enjoyable. In my opinion, the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide.

There are several reasons why group travel is superior to other methods. First, it is much more convenient than travelling alone. When you are part of a group, someone else is responsible for making all the travel arrangements. This means that you can simply sit back and relax, without having to worry about booking hotels or finding your way around a new city.

Second, travelling in a group is usually more affordable than travelling alone. This is because you can share the cost of transportation and accommodation with other people. Additionally, many tour companies offer discounts for group travel.

Finally, travelling in a group is a great way to meet new people and make new friends. When you travel alone, you are limited to meeting the people you already know. However, when you travel in a group, you have the opportunity to meet people from all over the world. This can be a great way to learn about new cultures and make lifelong friends.

Of course, there are some disadvantages to group travel as well. For example, you may not always be able to do what you want to do when you are part of a group. This is because you will have to compromise with other people in the group. Additionally, group travel can sometimes be more chaotic than travelling alone.

"The heated debate on the status of degree certificates has triggered a wide range of opinions. While some people regard it as a reliable measure to evaluate candidates’ academic performance, others contend that relying on degree certificates too much can distort young people’s career path. As for me, I agree that degree certificates should be taken into account as one of the criteria for making promotion decisions, but it'should not be deemed as the single standard.

In the first place, degree certificates can offer a comprehensive assessment of one’s academic ability. To obtain a degree in a certain major, a candidate needs to fulfill a set of requirements in terms of course credits and grades. It is a valid indicator to demonstrate the level of proficiency in a particular subject. Therefore, if an evaluation system puts too much emphasis on degree certificates, it can provide a fair assessment for those people who have achieved academic excellence.

On the other hand, the reliance on degree certificates can be oversimplified and misleading. In practice, possessing a degree does not always guarantee success. To advance in one’s career, a person should have other skills, such as communication and problem-solving capability, which are not indicated by degree certificates. For example, a project manager needs to have the abilities to coordinate different tasks simultaneously without making mistakes. To evaluate this kind of competence, the performance of a candidate in a job-specific test should be taken into consideration.

In conclusion, degree certificates are necessary components to measure one’s academic achievements and thus should be taken into account. However, it'should be kept in mind that a degree certificate is far from the only prerequisite for success and other skills are also important. Therefore, a balanced evaluation system should be established to evaluate candidates’ overall performance.

"Advantages of Limiting Car Usage

Limiting car usage has numerous advantages for both individuals and the environment. This is evident in the examples of Vauban, Paris, and Bogota, where innovative approaches to transportation have had positive effects. By reducing car dependency, these communities have managed to improve air quality, reduce traffic congestion, and promote alternative modes of transportation.

One of the main advantages of limiting car usage is the positive impact on the environment. According to the passage, passenger cars are responsible for a significant portion of greenhouse gas emissions. In Europe, cars account for 12 percent of these emissions, and in car-intensive areas in the United States, they contribute up to 50 percent. By reducing the number of cars on the road, as seen in Vauban and during the car-free day in Bogota, these communities are effectively reducing their carbon footprint and helping to combat climate change.

Additionally, limiting car usage can help alleviate traffic congestion. In Vauban, where car ownership is allowed but parking is restricted, 70 percent of families do not own cars. By encouraging alternative modes of transportation, such as walking, biking, and public transit, the streets in Vauban are quiet and free of traffic. This not only improves the quality of life for residents but also reduces the time wasted in traffic and the stress associated with driving.

Another advantage of limiting car usage is the promotion of healthier and more active lifestyles. Vauban, for example, has prioritized walking and biking by placing stores within walking distance and creating extensive bicycle paths. This encourages residents to engage in physical activity and leads to numerous health benefits. Similarly, during the car-free day in Bogota, millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated, or took buses to work, promoting physical activity and reducing sedentary behavior.

Finally, limiting car usage can have economic benefits. The passage mentions that delivery companies in Paris complained of lost revenue during the driving ban due to smog. However, this can be seen as an opportunity for alternative modes of transportation, such as bike and pedestrian couriers, to thrive. By diversifying the transportation industry and reducing dependence on cars, there is potential for job creation and economic growth.

In conclusion, limiting car usage offers numerous advantages for individuals and the environment. It improves air quality, reduces traffic congestion, promotes active lifestyles, and can have economic benefits. The examples of Vauban, Paris, and Bogota demonstrate the positive impacts of limiting car usage and provide inspiration for other communities to adopt similar practices.

"In recent years, the sustainability of the fashion industry has become an increasingly important topic. As consumers become more aware of their impact on the environment, they are looking for ways to reduce it. One way of doing this is by investing in sustainable apparel and accessories, such as clothing made from recycled materials or organic fabrics. This not only reduces waste but also helps promote a healthier lifestyle for all involved parties - both those that produce and purchase these items. The idea behind sustainable fashion centers on using resources responsibly and reducing our dependence on non-renewable sources like petroleum-based synthetic fibers and leather. Instead, we should look towards renewable options like hemp, bamboo or vegetable dyes when creating garments and accessories so that fewer resources are being depleted from our planet’s natural systems. Sustainable textiles come from either plants or animal sources (like cotton) which can be grown organically without toxins entering into their production process – this is key when making sure your purchase won't contribute to any pollution levels! Additionally, many brands have begun utilizing post-consumer plastics to create new products; this means turning previously discarded plastic bottles into fashionable items such as handbags or jackets. However, choosing sustainable alternatives isn't always easy since there's often a higher price tag associated with them due to the extra labor needed for production processes (though some companies take steps to make prices more reasonable). Additionally, secondhand stores provide shoppers with another option: purchasing gently used clothes at a fraction of what they'd cost if bought new. Not only does this save money but it prevents unwanted garments from ending up in landfills where they'll stay forever! Finally - when possible - opt out of buying fast fashion altogether; instead shop around until you find something timelessly stylish that won't go out of style within a few months' time period (which saves you even more money!).

Dear [State Senator’s Name],

I am writing to express my opinion on the topic of the Electoral College and whether it should be kept or replaced by a popular vote system in the election of the President of the United States. After carefully considering the arguments from various perspectives, I believe that the Electoral College should be maintained for five key reasons.

Firstly, the Electoral College provides certainty of outcome. As Judge Richard A. Posner highlights, the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College typically exceeds their share of the popular vote. This means that disputed outcomes are less likely under this system compared to a direct popular vote. In an era with highly polarized politics, maintaining a system that ensures a definitive winner is crucial in avoiding extended election crises.

Secondly, the Electoral College ensures that the President represents all regions of the country. With each region having a different set of interests and concerns, it is important for a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal. This prevents candidates from solely focusing on heavily populated areas and neglecting the concerns of smaller states. By requiring candidates to gain support from multiple regions, the Electoral College system helps preserve a sense of inclusiveness in the election process.

Thirdly, the Electoral College promotes the importance of swing states. In a winner-take-all system, candidates are incentivized to campaign heavily in states where the outcome is uncertain. This means that voters in these states receive more attention and information about the candidates, leading to more thoughtful decision-making. Ensuring that the swing states decide the election helps maximize voter engagement and enhances the overall quality of democratic decision-making.

Furthermore, the Electoral College restores political balance by giving some weight to large states. Although the Senate already provides a system of representation that balances the power between larger and smaller states, the Electoral College further reinforces this balance. By awarding electoral votes based on population, larger states naturally receive more attention from presidential candidates during campaigns, thereby ensuring that the concerns of both small and large states are taken into account.

Lastly, the Electoral College eliminates the need for run-off elections. In situations where no candidate receives a majority of the votes, the Electoral College automatically produces a clear winner. This prevents the need for complex and time-consuming run-off elections, which would only complicate the electoral process. The Electoral College simplifies the process and ensures that a single candidate emerges as the legitimate winner.

While I understand the arguments in favor of a popular vote system, such as the idea that it is more democratic and prevents the disenfranchisement of voters in states with no chance of winning, I believe that the current Electoral College system balances these concerns effectively.

In conclusion, the Electoral College should be preserved due to the certainty of outcome it provides, its ability to ensure that the President represents all regions of the country, the importance it places on swing states, the balance it restores to large states, and its ability to avoid run-off elections. These practical reasons outweigh the arguments for a popular vote system and demonstrate the strengths of the Electoral College in our democratic process.

Thank you for considering my viewpoint on this important matter. I trust that you will carefully weigh the pros and cons of both systems in making your decision.

Sincerely,

"Limiting car usage can have several advantages for both individuals and the environment. This trend is becoming more popular around the world, as exemplified by Vauban, a car-free suburb in Germany, and car-free days in cities like Paris and Bogota. By reducing car usage, we can address issues such as greenhouse gas emissions and promote alternative modes of transportation.

One of the main advantages of limiting car usage is the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. Cars contribute significantly to these emissions, especially in car-intensive areas. In Europe, passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions, while in some areas of the United States, this percentage can go up to 50 percent. By limiting car usage, we can greatly reduce these emissions and mitigate the effects of climate change.

Another advantage of reducing car usage is the promotion of alternative transportation modes. In the car-free suburb of Vauban, for example, residents rely on public transportation, biking, and walking to get around. This not only reduces the dependence on cars but also promotes a healthier and more active lifestyle. In cities like Paris and Bogota, car-free days have encouraged people to explore other means of transportation such as buses, taxis, biking, and walking. This not only reduces traffic congestion but also improves air quality and reduces noise pollution.

Additionally, limiting car usage can create more compact and accessible communities. In Vauban, stores are placed within walking distance on a main street, rather than being located in distant malls. This encourages people to walk or bike to their daily needs instead of relying on cars. Similarly, the car-free days in cities like Bogota promote a sense of community and social interaction, as people participate in alternative modes of transportation together.

The trend towards limiting car usage is not only limited to developed countries but is also gaining momentum in developing nations. In countries like Colombia, car-free days are becoming more popular and are spreading to other cities. This shows that reducing car usage is not just a localized solution but a global movement towards sustainable and livable cities.

In conclusion, limiting car usage can have numerous advantages for individuals and the environment. By reducing greenhouse gas emissions, promoting alternative modes of transportation, and creating more accessible communities, we can contribute to a more sustainable and healthier future. As more cities and communities around the world adopt car-free initiatives, it is clear that this trend is here to stay.",True

"Success is a subjective term that can be defined in various ways. However, one thing is for sure that successful people are always open to new ideas and take risks to achieve their goals. I strongly agree with this statement because trying new things and taking risks can lead to personal and professional growth, provide opportunities for learning, and increase the chances of success.

Firstly, trying new things and taking risks can lead to personal and professional growth. When we step out of our comfort zones and try something new, we challenge ourselves and push ourselves to achieve more. We may encounter failures or setbacks, but these experiences can teach us valuable lessons that we can apply to future endeavors. For instance, if a person who has always worked in an office decides to start their own business, they may face challenges and obstacles that they have never encountered before. However, by taking risks and learning from their mistakes, they can develop new skills and gain valuable experience that can help them grow both personally and professionally.

Secondly, trying new things and taking risks can provide opportunities for learning. When we are willing to try new things, we expose ourselves to new ideas, perspectives, and experiences. We may learn something new about ourselves or the world around us, which can broaden our horizons and expand our knowledge base. For example, if a person decides to travel to a foreign country, they may encounter different cultures, languages, and customs. By immersing themselves in these new experiences, they can learn about different ways of life and gain a better understanding of the world.

Lastly, trying new things and taking risks increase the chances of success. Success often requires taking calculated risks and trying new approaches. If we only stick to what we know and what we are comfortable with, we may miss out on opportunities to achieve our goals. For instance, if a person wants to advance in their career, they may need to take on new challenges, learn new skills, or take on additional responsibilities. By taking risks and trying new things, they can demonstrate their abilities and increase their chances of success.

In conclusion, trying new things and taking risks are essential for success. By being willing to step out of our comfort zones, we can grow both personally and professionally, learn new things, and increase our chances of success. While there may be risks involved, the potential rewards are well worth it. Therefore, I encourage everyone to embrace new experiences and take risks to achieve their goals.

"'The Face on Mars': Just a Natural Landform

The idea that there is a giant face on Mars has captured the attention of many people for decades. Some people believe that it was created by a long-lost civilization or even aliens. However, scientists at NASA have studied the images of the Face and have concluded that it is just a natural landform. In this essay, I will present three claims and evidence from the article 'Unmasking the Face on Mars' to support my argument that the Face is indeed a natural landform.

First, the Face does not show any signs of being artificially created. According to the article, the Face appears to be just a mesa, similar to those found on Earth. It was formed by natural geological processes and weathering over millions of years. The article also states that the Face lacks any features that would suggest it was created by intelligent life. There are no signs of roads or buildings, and the edges of the Face are not straight or precise.

Second, the images of the Face were taken at different angles and lighting conditions, which can make it appear more like a face than a natural landform. The article explains that the original image of the Face was taken at a low angle, which made the mesa resemble a face. Later images taken at different angles and lighting conditions showed that the mesa did not look as much like a face. Additionally, the article explains that the human brain is wired to see patterns and faces, even where none exist. This psychological phenomenon, known as pareidolia, likely contributed to the belief that the Face was created by aliens or a lost civilization.

Lastly, the article discusses the history of the belief in the Face being created by aliens. It explains that this idea gained popularity in the 1970s and 1980s, when people were fascinated by the possibility of extraterrestrial life. However, as our understanding of Mars has improved, the idea that the Face was created by aliens has become less credible. The article states that no evidence of life has been found on Mars, and it is unlikely that there are any advanced civilizations there.

In conclusion, the idea that the Face on Mars was created by aliens or a long-lost civilization is not supported by evidence. The Face is simply a natural landform that resembles a face only in certain lighting conditions and when viewed at the right angle. While it is understandable that some people find the idea of",True

The decision of how many extra-curricular activities a student should take should be left to the student and their family members. This is because it allows the student and their family members to make the best decision based on the student's interests and abilities. By exposing students to a variety of activities outside of school, they are able to better understand their passions and learn new skills.

For example, joining a robotics club can teach students principles of engineering and help them develop their teamwork and problem-solving skills. It also gives a creative outlet for those students who may prefer to explore interests outside of school hours. Similarly, joining a sports team at school can provide students with an opportunity to learn valuable skills such as leadership, collaboration, and time management, which are great assets in today's competitive job market.

On the other hand, schools worry that doing too many extra-activities may negatively affect a student's studies and their grades. By spreading themselves too thin, students may find it difficult to focus and devote enough time to certain assignments, resulting in lower academic performance. Additionally, when a student is too involved in extracurricular activities, they may become overwhelmed, leading to increased stress levels and possibly even burnout.

Ultimately, the decision of how many extra-curricular activities a student should take should be left to the student and their family members. By providing students with the proper guidance and support, they can learn the skills and values needed to succeed in the future, while still performing well in school.",True

Self-esteem can be achieved through a variety of activities that focus on different aspects of one's life. Respect, effort, and behavior all have an impact on self-esteem. By building strong relationships with friends and family, forming healthy habits, and taking pride in the work that one is capable of, it is possible to feel better about oneself. 

Respect for oneself is an important factor in maintaining self-esteem. Considering one's actions and what kind of impact they have on others will help form a sense of self-worth. Being mindful of how one is treated and how one treats others helps create a sense of security.

Making a conscious effort to build better habits and take ownership of one's behavior is also necessary for self-esteem. Instead of taking the easy way out, putting in the time and energy to get the job done is an effective way to build self-confidence. Along with this comes the idea that even if mistakes are made, a person can learn from them and be open to the idea of growth and improvement.

Education can help build self-esteem, too. Learning new skills, tactics, and knowledge can lead to new opportunities and experiences. Learning how to prioritize tasks and develop organizational skills will lead to better functioning in everyday life.

Ultimately, having a sense of self-esteem comes from within, and the only person who can make it happen is the one taking the steps necessary to make it happen. When respect for oneself and others, effort, and behavior are all considered, it is possible to attain a healthy sense of self-esteem.",True
"Advantages of Limiting Car Usage

Limiting car usage can have numerous advantages for both individuals and society as a whole. The passages provided highlight some of these advantages, including a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, improved air quality, and increased access to alternative transportation options.

One of the main advantages of limiting car usage is the impact it has on reducing greenhouse gas emissions. As stated in the passages, passenger cars are responsible for a significant percentage of greenhouse gas emissions in both Europe and the United States. By limiting car usage, especially in suburban areas where car dependency is high, it is possible to reduce these emissions and mitigate the negative effects of climate change. This is particularly important as efforts to curb greenhouse gas emissions become more urgent on a global scale.

In addition to reducing greenhouse gas emissions, limiting car usage can also improve air quality.

The passage about Vauban, Germany, showcases a community that has embraced a car-free lifestyle. In this community, residents have access to a tram system and convenient walking and biking infrastructure. By designing communities in a way that prioritizes public transportation and pedestrian-friendly spaces, it becomes easier for residents to rely less on cars and utilize other forms of transportation. This not only reduces traffic congestion but also promotes a more active and healthier lifestyle.

Moreover, limiting car usage can have economic benefits. The passage about Bogota, Colombia, highlights the success of a car-free day initiative in reducing traffic congestion and promoting alternative forms of transportation. By reducing the number of cars on the road, cities can save on infrastructure costs associated with building and maintaining roads and parking facilities. Additionally, car-free initiatives can boost local economies by promoting the use of public transit, walking, and biking, which in turn supports local businesses and reduces the reliance on car-centric industries.

In conclusion, limiting car usage has numerous advantages for individuals and society as a whole. It can reduce greenhouse gas emissions, improve air quality, increase access to alternative transportation options, and have economic benefits. As the passages demonstrate, this approach is being embraced in various parts of the world and can contribute to creating healthier, more sustainable, and livable communities. By prioritizing alternative transportation and designing communities with less emphasis on car dependency, individuals and society can reap the benefits of limiting car usage.",True
"The purpose of a university education is not just to prepare students for employment. Universities offer students the opportunity to learn and develop their skills in a variety of disciplines. A university education can also give students the opportunity to explore different fields of study and to develop new skills.

Some people think that the university education is only for those who are planning on working in a specific field. Others believe that a university education can give students a better understanding of the world around them and can help them develop broad skills.

An example of how a university education can help students develop broad skills is when a student takes a course in art history. By studying art history, the student will learn about different styles of art, the history of the art world, and the meaning of art. This type of education can give the student a better understanding of the world around them and can help him or her to develop critical thinking skills.

Another example of how a university education can help students develop broad skills is when a student takes a course in business. By studying business, the student will learn about the different aspects of business, such as finance, marketing, and management. This type of education can give the student the skills necessary to succeed in a career in business.

Overall, I believe that a university education is more than just preparation for employment. A university education can give students the opportunity to learn about different subjects and to develop skills that will help them in their future careers.

"Title: The Advantages of Limiting Car Usage: A Global Transition

Our world is witnessing a subtle yet significant shift in our transport paradigm, as increasingly, societies are leaning towards reduced car usage. This essay examines the advantages of limiting car usage through evidence taken from different global scenarios.

Vauban, a German suburb, provides an illuminating example. A car-free zone except for a few areas, 70% of Vauban's families don't own cars (Rosenthal, In German Suburb). This lifestyle transforms communities, resulting in stress-free citizens who admit to being happier without cars (Rosenthal, In German Suburb). 

Minimizing car usage not only leads to improved quality of life but also contributes significantly to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. Cars account for up to 50% of these emissions in some regions, exacerbating global warming (Rosenthal, In German Suburb). In replacing cars with alternative modes of transport, we can combat climate change more effectively.

Moreover, reduced car usage lessens the stress on urban infrastructures due to congestion and overpopulation. During a partial driving ban in Paris, congestion was reduced by 60%, to the relief of Parisian commuters (Duffer, Paris Bans Driving). In Bogota, Colombia, a car-free day significantly reduced traffic jams, promoting alternative means of commuting, such as hiking, biking, and public transportation (Selsky, Car-free Day). 

Yet another point to consider is the change that the decreased dependency on cars has brought forth in urban planning. Modern suburbs around the world, taking a cue from Vauban, focus on being compact and accessible to public transportation rather than car-oriented (Rosenthal, In German Suburb). Accommodating fewer private vehicles results in urban spaces that cater better to human needs, such as walking, biking, and public transit.

A shift in societal behavior is also prompting a change in car usage. Research from the United States - a country with a historically profound car culture - shows that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less, and getting fewer licenses (Rosenthal, The End of Car Culture). This trend mirrors a significant cultural shift empowered by modern technology. With telecommuting becoming widespread and the urban core renewing its appeal, the necessity for a car is dwindling.

Some might argue that the limitations on car usage could bring adversity to the automobile industry. Indeed, many automobile companies recognize this trend and are recasting themselves as ""mobility"" companies (Rosenthal, The End of Car Culture). This fundamental shift emphasizes the inevitability of the change in our relationship with cars and the benefits of embracing it.

In conclusion, the benefits of limiting car usage extend globally and environmentally. The evidence presented in this essay demonstrates that this is not only feasible but also beneficial for the broader community. As we collectively strive for a green planet and vibrant, dynamic cities, limiting car usage is indeed a pivotal step in the right direction.",True

"Success is a subjective term that means different things to different people. However, one common trait among successful people is their willingness to try new things and take risks. I completely agree with this statement as it is evident from the lives of successful people who have achieved great heights by stepping out of their comfort zone and trying new things.

Firstly, trying new things and taking risks helps individuals to grow and learn. When people do what they already know how to do well, they tend to become complacent and stop growing. On the other hand, when they try new things, they challenge themselves and learn new skills. For instance, Elon Musk, the CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, is known for taking risks and trying new things. He started SpaceX, a private space exploration company, when the world was skeptical about the feasibility of such a venture. However, he persevered and today SpaceX is one of the leading space exploration companies in the world.

Secondly, trying new things and taking risks can lead to new opportunities and success. When individuals step out of their comfort zone and try new things, they open themselves up to new opportunities that they may not have considered before. For example, J. K. Rowling, the author of the Harry Potter series, was rejected by several publishers before finally getting her book published. She took a risk by writing a book in a genre that was not popular at the time, and this risk paid off as her book became a bestseller and led to a successful career as an author.

Lastly, trying new things and taking risks can lead to personal growth and fulfillment. When individuals challenge themselves and try new things, they gain a sense of accomplishment and fulfillment. This can lead to increased self-confidence and a sense of purpose. For instance, Oprah Winfrey, the media mogul, started her career as a news anchor but took a risk by starting her own talk show. This risk paid off as her show became a huge success and led to her becoming one of the most influential women in the world.

In conclusion, trying new things and taking risks is a crucial factor in achieving success. It helps individuals to grow and learn, opens up new opportunities, and leads to personal growth and fulfillment. Successful people are not afraid to step out of their comfort zone and try new things, and this is what sets them apart from others. Therefore, it is important for individuals to embrace new challenges and take risks in order to achieve success in their lives.

This transformation revitalizes the urban landscape, enhancing the overall quality of life for city residents. Less reliance on private cars translates to reduced traffic congestion, shorter commute times, and lower stress levels for urban inhabitants. Furthermore, car ownership can be a significant financial burden, and by depending less on private vehicles, residents have the opportunity to save money on car-related expenses, improving their financial stability.  However, transitioning to car-free cities is not without its unique set of challenges. Many individuals heavily rely on their cars for daily activities and commutes, which can result in resistance to the transition due to concerns about inconvenience and a perceived loss of personal freedom. Effective public transportation is essential for the success of car-free cities, and substantial investments are required to expand and enhance public transit systems, providing convenient alternatives to private cars. Businesses that depend on car-dependent customers may experience declining revenues during the transition, necessitating solutions to mitigate the economic impact. Redesigning urban areas for car-free living is a complex and time-consuming process, requiring comprehensive planning and substantial investments in infrastructure.  To successfully implement car-free cities, solutions include expanding and improving public transportation, promoting active transportation methods such as walking and cycling, encouraging carpooling and ride-sharing, adopting electric and sustainable transportation options, and focusing on public education and awareness.  In conclusion, car-free cities offer a visionary perspective on more sustainable, healthier, and community-centric urban living. Despite the challenges, the potential benefits in terms of environmental sustainability, public health, efficient urban living, and cost savings make them a worthwhile aspiration. By investing in public transportation, promoting alternative transportation methods, and engaging the public in the planning process, cities can work toward a future where private cars are no longer the dominant mode of transportation.

Many of us strive to build our self-esteem each day. Some use achievement, while others gravitate towards being praised. 

Achievement awards us with a sense of accomplishment, and in turn may boost our self-esteem. In modern society, there is a lot of pressure to achieve. We are consistently striving for success, even if it is not our own. This can lead to us becoming focused on external goals.

On the other hand, praise is often seen as a way to build self-esteem without the pressure that comes with achievement. Being complimented allows us to feel more positively about ourselves. However, it may not always be rooted in reality, as it often relies on somebody else’s opinion. It also can become overused and stop having the same effect.

In general, true self-esteem is better built through achievement because it relies on our own successful pursuits, rather than external validation. It helps us to develop confidence in our own abilities, and learn where we need to work harder. Though there is pressure involved, focusing on our own goals as our source of validation can prove to be extremely rewarding.",True
"In today's world, competition is considered a crucial aspect of success. However, when it comes to children, the debate is whether they should be taught to compete or cooperate. In my opinion, children should be taught to cooperate rather than compete. This essay will explain why I believe so.

To begin with, cooperation is a fundamental skill that children need to learn to succeed in life. In the real world, success is not just about individual achievement but also about working together with others. In a team, each member has a unique set of skills and knowledge that they can contribute to achieve a common goal. Therefore, children who learn to cooperate are more likely to be successful in their personal and professional lives.

Moreover, cooperation teaches children important values such as empathy, respect, and responsibility. When children learn to work together, they learn to understand and appreciate the differences in others. They also learn to respect the opinions and ideas of others, which is essential for building healthy relationships. Additionally, cooperation teaches children to take responsibility for their actions and to be accountable for their mistakes. These values are crucial for building a strong character and becoming a responsible citizen.

On the other hand, competition can have negative effects on children's development. When children are taught to compete, they may become overly focused on winning and may develop a fear of failure. This can lead to anxiety, stress, and low self-esteem. Moreover, competition can create a hostile environment where children may feel isolated and unsupported. This can have a detrimental effect on their mental health and well-being.

In conclusion, I strongly believe that children should be taught to cooperate rather than compete. Cooperation teaches children important skills and values that are essential for success in life. Moreover, it promotes a positive and supportive environment that fosters healthy relationships and mental well-being. Therefore, parents and educators should focus on teaching children to work together and to appreciate the value of teamwork.
