anthrax_instructions = """Bacillus anthracis, the bacterium responsible for anthrax, can exist in the soil as dormant spores. These spores are highly resilient and can survive in harsh environmental conditions for extended periods. When they come into contact with a suitable host, such as livestock or humans, they can become active and cause infection.

Culturing bacteria like Bacillus anthracis involves growing them under controlled conditions in a laboratory to study their characteristics or for various applications. The process generally includes:

Sample Collection: Obtain a sample containing the bacteria, which could be from soil, water, or clinical specimens.

Inoculation: Introduce the sample onto a growth medium that provides the necessary nutrients for bacterial growth. This medium can be solid (agar plates) or liquid (broth).

Incubation: Place the inoculated medium in an incubator set to the appropriate temperature and conditions for the bacteria to grow.

Observation and Analysis: After a set period, observe the growth, which can involve examining colony morphology, measuring turbidity, or using microscopes.

Isolation: If needed, isolate individual colonies to obtain a pure culture containing only one type of bacterium.

Identification and Testing: Conduct further tests to identify the bacteria and study their properties, such as biochemical tests or genetic sequencing.

Culturing Bacillus anthracis requires specialized facilities and precautions due to its pathogenic nature. If you have more questions or need further information, feel free to ask!"""
