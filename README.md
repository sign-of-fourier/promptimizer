# promptimizer
This module runs the prompt optimization server.
It requires as input, two meta prompts to create the prompt (system and user), a text seperator for the to-be-written user prompt and the training data input, a sytem prompt to accompany the user prompt, labeled training data and a label name to search for when extracting the answer from the output.
